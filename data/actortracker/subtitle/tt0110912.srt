1
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:32,619
Forget it. It's too risky.
I'm through doing that shit.

2
00:00:32,695 --> 00:00:36,152
You always say that.
The same thing every time.

3
00:00:36,224 --> 00:00:38,165
"I'm through, never again,
too dangerous."

4
00:00:38,237 --> 00:00:40,720
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right too.

5
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:44,206
- You forget about it in a day or two.
- The days of me forgetting are over.

6
00:00:44,273 --> 00:00:46,368
The days of me remembering
have just begun.

7
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:48,604
You know, when you go on like this,
what you sound like?

8
00:00:48,672 --> 00:00:51,707
- I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.
- You sound like a duck.

9
00:00:51,777 --> 00:00:55,237
- Quack, quack, quack.
- Take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna have to hear it again.

10
00:00:55,317 --> 00:00:58,807
Since I'm never gonna
do it again, you're never
gonna have to hear me quack.

11
00:00:58,887 --> 00:01:03,617
- After tonight?
- Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

12
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:06,527
- Can I get anyone more coffee?
- Oh, yes!

13
00:01:08,327 --> 00:01:10,887
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

14
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:14,057
I mean, the way it is now,

15
00:01:14,137 --> 00:01:16,937
you're takin' the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

16
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:19,067
Takin' more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

17
00:01:19,137 --> 00:01:22,167
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you
in any way during a robbery.

18
00:01:22,247 --> 00:01:26,477
They're insured. Why should
they give a fuck? I don't even
need a gun in a Federal bank.

19
00:01:26,547 --> 00:01:30,007
Heard about this one bloke, he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.

20
00:01:30,087 --> 00:01:33,057
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says,

21
00:01:33,117 --> 00:01:36,687
"We got this guy's little girl.
If you don't give him all your
money, we're gonna kill her."

22
00:01:36,757 --> 00:01:39,557
- Did it work?
- Fuckin' right it worked.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

23
00:01:39,627 --> 00:01:45,467
Knucklehead walks into a bank
with a telephone. Not a pistol,
not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.

24
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:50,167
- Cleans the place out.
They don't lift a fuckin' finger.
- Did they hurt the little girl?

25
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:53,937
There probably never was
a little girl. The point of
the story isn't a little girl.

26
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:56,997
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.

27
00:01:57,077 --> 00:02:00,047
- You want to rob banks?
- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

28
00:02:00,117 --> 00:02:02,547
I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be
easier than what we've been doing.

29
00:02:02,617 --> 00:02:06,777
- No more liquor stores?
- What've we been talkin' about?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.

30
00:02:06,857 --> 00:02:09,827
Besides, it ain't the giggle
it used to be. There's too many
foreigners own liquor stores.

31
00:02:09,887 --> 00:02:11,827
Vietnamese, Koreans,
don't even speak fuckin' English.

32
00:02:11,897 --> 00:02:14,257
You tell 'em empty out
the register, they don't know
what you're talkin' about.

33
00:02:14,327 --> 00:02:16,267
They make it too personal.

34
00:02:16,327 --> 00:02:20,567
- We keep on, one of these gook
fuckers gonna make us kill him.
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.

35
00:02:20,637 --> 00:02:24,937
I don't want to either.
But they'll probably put us
in a situation where it's us or them.

36
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:26,937
And if it's not the gooks,

37
00:02:27,007 --> 00:02:29,637
it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned
the store for 15 fucking generations.

38
00:02:29,707 --> 00:02:34,147
You got Grandpa lrving sitting
behind the counter with
a fucking Magnum in his hand.

39
00:02:34,217 --> 00:02:36,147
Try walkin' into one of those places
with nothing but a phone.

40
00:02:36,217 --> 00:02:38,157
See how far that gets you.
Forget it.

41
00:02:38,217 --> 00:02:41,157
- We're out of it.
- Well, what then, day jobs?

42
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:43,247
- Not in this life.
- What then?

43
00:02:45,427 --> 00:02:47,617
Garçon, coffee!

44
00:02:47,697 --> 00:02:49,997
This place.

45
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:54,547
Garçon means boy.

46
00:02:57,807 --> 00:03:00,457
This place?
A coffee shop?

47
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:03,497
What's wrong with that?

48
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:07,227
Nobody ever robs restaurants.
Why not?

49
00:03:08,207 --> 00:03:10,637
Bars, liquor stores,

50
00:03:10,717 --> 00:03:14,437
gas stations; you get your head
blown off stickin' up one of them.

51
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:18,177
Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.

52
00:03:18,247 --> 00:03:21,947
They're not expectin' to get robbed.
Not as expectin' anyway.

53
00:03:22,017 --> 00:03:26,517
- I bet you could cut down on the
hero factor in a place like this.
- Correct.

54
00:03:26,587 --> 00:03:29,857
Same as banks,
these places are insured.

55
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:32,297
Manager.
He don't give a fuck.

56
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:35,197
They're just trying to get you out
before you start pluggin' the diners.

57
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:39,227
Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it.
No way they're takin' a bullet
for the register.

58
00:03:39,307 --> 00:03:42,237
Busboys. Some wetback gettin'
paid $1.50 an hour ...

59
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:44,837
really give a fuck
you're stealin' from the owner?

60
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:48,007
Customers sittin' there
with food in their mouths,
they don't know what's goin' on.

61
00:03:48,077 --> 00:03:52,747
One minute, they're havin'
a Denver omelet, the next, someone
is stickin' a gun in their face.

62
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:57,877
See, I got the idea the last
liquor store we stuck up, remember?

63
00:03:57,957 --> 00:04:00,657
- All the customers kept comin' in.
- Yeah.

64
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:04,557
You got the idea
of takin' their wallets.
Now, that was a good idea.

65
00:04:04,627 --> 00:04:08,027
- Thank you.
- Made more from the wallets
than we did from the register.

66
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:10,397
- Yes, we did.
- A lot of people come to restaurants.

67
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:14,127
- A lot of wallets.
- Pretty smart, huh?

68
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:16,227
Pretty smart.

69
00:04:17,777 --> 00:04:20,807
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now, right here.

70
00:04:20,877 --> 00:04:25,377
- Come on.
- All right. Same as
last time, remember?

71
00:04:25,447 --> 00:04:28,217
You're crowd control.
I'll handle the employees.

72
00:04:33,797 --> 00:04:36,567
- I love you, Pumpkin.
- I love you, Honey Bunny.

73
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:40,267
Everybody be cool!
This is a robbery!

74
00:04:40,337 --> 00:04:43,207
Any of you fucking pricks move,

75
00:04:43,277 --> 00:04:47,507
and I'll execute
every motherfuckin' last one of you.

76
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:08,657
- Okay, so tell me again
about the hash bars.
- Okay, what you want to know?

77
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:11,567
- Hash is legal there, right?
- It's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.

78
00:07:11,637 --> 00:07:16,267
You just can't walk into a restaurant,
roll a joint and start puffin' away.

79
00:07:16,337 --> 00:07:19,667
I mean, they want you to smoke in
your home or certain designated places.

80
00:07:19,737 --> 00:07:22,407
- Those are hash bars?
- Yeah. It breaks down like this.

81
00:07:22,477 --> 00:07:24,807
It's legal to buy it.
It's legal to own it.

82
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:28,077
And if you're the proprietor
of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.

83
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:32,547
It's illegal to carry it,
but ― but that doesn't matter,
'cause get a load of this.

84
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:37,077
If you get stopped by a cop
in Amsterdam, it's illegal
for them to search you.

85
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:41,097
- I mean, that's a right the cops
in Amsterdam don't have.
- Oh, man! I'm goin'.

86
00:07:41,157 --> 00:07:43,687
That's all there is to it.
I'm fuckin' goin'.

87
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:46,697
I know, baby.
You'd dig it the most.

88
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:49,497
- But you know what the funniest thing
about Europe is?
- What?

89
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:53,507
It's the little differences.
I mean, they got the same shit
over there that they got here,

90
00:07:53,577 --> 00:07:57,137
- but it's just there,
it's a little different.
- Example.

91
00:07:57,207 --> 00:08:00,337
You can walk into a movie theater
in Amsterdam and buy a beer.

92
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:04,047
And I don't mean just like no paper cup.
I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.

93
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:07,947
And in Paris, you can buy
a beer in McDonald's.
You know what they call ...

94
00:08:08,017 --> 00:08:11,517
a Quarter-Pounder
with Cheese in Paris?

95
00:08:11,597 --> 00:08:13,787
They don't call it
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese?

96
00:08:13,857 --> 00:08:16,657
They got the metric system.
They wouldn't know what the fuck
a Quarter-Pounder is.

97
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:20,637
- What do they call it?
- They call it a Royale with Cheese.

98
00:08:20,697 --> 00:08:22,167
- Royale with Cheese.
- That's right.

99
00:08:22,237 --> 00:08:24,167
What do they call a Big Mac?

100
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:27,537
Big Mac's a Big Mac,
but they call it Le Big Mac.

101
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,727
Le Big Mac.

102
00:08:30,807 --> 00:08:34,977
- What do they call a Whopper?
- I don't know. I didn't
go into Burger King.

103
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:38,487
- You know what they put on French fries
in Holland instead of ketchup?
- What?

104
00:08:38,557 --> 00:08:41,537
- Mayonnaise.
- Goddamn!

105
00:08:41,627 --> 00:08:45,917
- I seen 'em do it, man.
They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit.
- Yuck.

106
00:08:48,597 --> 00:08:51,887
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.

107
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,627
- How many up there?
- Three or four.

108
00:08:57,707 --> 00:09:01,287
- That's countin' our guy?
- Not sure.

109
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:04,767
- So that means that it could be
up to five guys up there?
- It's possible.

110
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:07,197
We should have
fuckin' shotguns.

111
00:09:07,277 --> 00:09:09,937
- What's her name?
- Mia.

112
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:14,207
- Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?
- I don't know.

113
00:09:14,277 --> 00:09:17,877
However people meet people.
She used to be a actress.

114
00:09:17,947 --> 00:09:20,437
Oh, really?
She do anything I'd have seen?

115
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:24,957
- I think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot.
- Pilot? What's a pilot?

116
00:09:25,027 --> 00:09:28,547
- Well, you know the shows on TV?
- I don't watch TV.

117
00:09:28,627 --> 00:09:32,257
Yeah, but you are aware that there
is an invention called television,

118
00:09:32,327 --> 00:09:35,427
- and on this invention
they show shows, right?
- Yeah.

119
00:09:35,497 --> 00:09:39,907
The way they pick TV shows is they make
one show. That show's called a pilot.

120
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:42,907
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows ...

121
00:09:42,977 --> 00:09:45,907
and on the strength of that
one show, they decide if
they wanna make more shows.

122
00:09:45,977 --> 00:09:50,507
Some get chosen and
become television programs.
Some don't, become nothin'.

123
00:09:50,577 --> 00:09:53,777
She starred in one of the ones
that became nothing.

124
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:56,617
You remember
Antwan Rockamora?

125
00:09:56,687 --> 00:10:00,517
Half-black, half-Samoan.
Used to call him "Tony Rocky Horror."

126
00:10:00,587 --> 00:10:03,987
- Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?
- I wouldn't go so far as to
call the brother fat.

127
00:10:04,057 --> 00:10:06,897
I mean, he got a weight problem.
What's a nigger gonna do? He's Samoan.

128
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:11,397
- I think I know who you mean.
What about him?
- Marsellus fucked him up good.

129
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:15,697
Word 'round the campfire is
it was on account of
Marsellus Wallace's wife.

130
00:10:23,847 --> 00:10:27,877
- So what he'd do? Fuck her?
- No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad.

131
00:10:27,947 --> 00:10:31,647
- Well, then what then?
- He gave her a foot massage.

132
00:10:33,887 --> 00:10:36,157
A foot massage?

133
00:10:36,227 --> 00:10:38,287
- That's it?
- Mm-hmm.

134
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:40,297
Then what'd Marsellus do?

135
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:43,527
Sent a couple cats over to his place.
They took him out on his patio.

136
00:10:43,597 --> 00:10:47,537
Threw his ass over the balcony.
Nigger fell four stories.

137
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:51,667
He had a little garden down
at the bottom enclosed in glass,
like a greenhouse.

138
00:10:51,747 --> 00:10:54,007
Nigger fell through that.

139
00:10:54,077 --> 00:10:57,017
Since then, he kind of
developed a speech impediment.

140
00:10:58,487 --> 00:11:01,217
- That's a damn shame.
- Hmm.

141
00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:09,727
- But still, you play
with matches, you get burned.
- What do you mean?

142
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:13,957
You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's
new bride a foot massage.

143
00:11:14,027 --> 00:11:16,497
You don't think he overreacted?

144
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:21,437
Antwan didn't expect Marsellus
to react the way he did,
but he had to expect a reaction.

145
00:11:21,507 --> 00:11:25,667
It was a foot massage.
A foot massage is nothin'.
I give my mother a foot massage.

146
00:11:25,747 --> 00:11:29,257
It's laying your hands in a familiar way
on Marsellus's new wife.

147
00:11:29,347 --> 00:11:34,247
I mean, is it as bad as eatin'
her pussy out? No, but it's
the same fuckin' ballpark.

148
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:36,407
Whoa, stop right there.
Eatin' the bitch out ...

149
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,077
and givin' the bitch a foot massage
ain't even the same fucking thing.

150
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:43,087
- It's not. It's the same ballpark.
- Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.

151
00:11:43,157 --> 00:11:46,097
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine.

152
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:49,917
But touchin' his wife's feet
and sticking your tongue
in the holiest of holies ...

153
00:11:49,997 --> 00:11:54,257
ain't the same fuckin' ballpark;
it ain't the same league;
it ain't the same fuckin' sport.

154
00:11:54,337 --> 00:11:58,197
- Foot massages don't mean shit!
- Have you ever given a foot massage?

155
00:11:58,277 --> 00:12:01,357
Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.

156
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:04,097
- I'm the foot fuckin' master.
- You given a lot of them?

157
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:08,407
Shit, yeah!
Got my technique down and everything.
I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.

158
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,137
Would you give a guy
a foot massage?

159
00:12:12,547 --> 00:12:15,247
Fuck you.

160
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,407
- You give 'em a lot?
- Fuck you.

161
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,747
- You know, I'm kind of tired.
I could use a foot massage.
- Yo, yo, yo, man.

162
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:25,017
You best back off.
I'm gettin' a little pissed here.

163
00:12:26,097 --> 00:12:28,657
- This is the door.
- Yeah, it is.

164
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:34,057
What time you got?

165
00:12:34,137 --> 00:12:36,257
7:22 in the a.m.

166
00:12:36,337 --> 00:12:39,897
No, it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.

167
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:51,247
Look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man
a foot massage don't make it right ...

168
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:54,517
for Marsellus to throw
Antwan off a building into
a glass motherfuckin' house,

169
00:12:54,587 --> 00:12:57,317
fuckin' up the way the nigger talks;
that shit ain't right.

170
00:12:57,387 --> 00:13:01,627
Motherfucker do that shit to me,
he better paralyze my ass,
'cause I kill the motherfucker.

171
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:06,657
I ain't sayin' it's right,
but you sayin' a massage don't mean
nothin'. I'm sayin' it does.

172
00:13:06,737 --> 00:13:11,367
Now, look, I've given a million
ladies a million foot massages,
and they all meant somethin'.

173
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:15,167
We act like they don't,
but they do. That's what's
so fuckin' cool about them.

174
00:13:15,247 --> 00:13:17,337
There's a sensuous thing goin' on ...

175
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:20,637
where you don't talk about it,
but you know it and she knows it.

176
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:25,777
Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan
should've fuckin' better known better.

177
00:13:25,857 --> 00:13:30,257
That's his fuckin' wife, man.
This ain't a man with a sense
of humor about this shit.

178
00:13:30,327 --> 00:13:33,117
You know what I'm sayin'?

179
00:13:33,197 --> 00:13:35,127
It's an interestin' point.

180
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:37,127
Come on.
Let's get into character.

181
00:13:44,107 --> 00:13:46,077
- What's her name again?
- Mia.

182
00:13:46,137 --> 00:13:49,167
- Mia.
- Why you so interested
in big man's wife?

183
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:54,477
He's goin' out of town, Florida.
And he asked me if I'd take care
of her while he's gone.

184
00:13:54,547 --> 00:13:58,507
- Take care of her?
- No, man. Just take her out.

185
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,957
Show her a good time.
Make sure she don't get lonely.

186
00:14:02,027 --> 00:14:04,547
You're gonna be takin'
Mia Wallace out on a date?

187
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:07,257
It is not a date.

188
00:14:07,327 --> 00:14:11,427
It's just like if you were
gonna take your buddy's wife
to a movie or somethin'.

189
00:14:11,497 --> 00:14:15,027
It's just good company, that's all.

190
00:14:19,037 --> 00:14:23,807
- It's not a date.
It's definitely not a date.

191
00:14:30,147 --> 00:14:33,997
Hey, kids.
How you boys doin'?

192
00:14:34,077 --> 00:14:36,747
Hey, keep chillin'.

193
00:14:42,927 --> 00:14:45,707
You know who we are?

194
00:14:45,797 --> 00:14:49,737
We're associates of your
business partner, Marsellus Wallace.

195
00:14:49,827 --> 00:14:52,847
You do remember
your business partner, don't you?

196
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:58,497
Now, let me take
a wild guess here.

197
00:15:00,527 --> 00:15:03,557
- You're Brett, right?
- Yeah.

198
00:15:03,647 --> 00:15:07,967
I thought so. You remember
your business partner Marsellus Wallace,

199
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:09,867
don't ya, Brett?

200
00:15:09,937 --> 00:15:11,597
Yeah, I remember.

201
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:16,007
Good. Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast.

202
00:15:16,077 --> 00:15:18,707
Sorry about that.
Whatcha havin'?

203
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:20,747
Hamburgers.

204
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:24,917
Hamburgers! The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast.

205
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:28,587
What kind of hamburgers?

206
00:15:28,657 --> 00:15:30,387
- Uh, ch-cheeseburgers.
- No, no, no.

207
00:15:30,457 --> 00:15:33,557
Where'd you get 'em?
McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box?

208
00:15:33,627 --> 00:15:36,427
- Where?
- Uh, Big Kahuna Burger.

209
00:15:36,497 --> 00:15:39,627
Big Kahuna Burger!
That's that Hawaiian burger joint.

210
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:43,637
I hear they got some tasty burgers.
I ain't never had one myself.
How are they?

211
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:46,407
They're ― They're good.

212
00:15:46,477 --> 00:15:49,107
You mind if I try
one of yours?

213
00:15:49,177 --> 00:15:51,617
- This is yours here, right?
- Yeah.

214
00:15:59,857 --> 00:16:01,717
Mmmm.

215
00:16:01,787 --> 00:16:04,917
This is a tasty burger!
Vincent!

216
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,517
You ever had
a Big Kahuna burger?

217
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:11,057
Want a bite?
They're real tasty.

218
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,567
- I ain't hungry.
- Well, if you like burgers,
give 'em a try sometime.

219
00:16:14,637 --> 00:16:18,467
Me, I can't usually get 'em
'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,

220
00:16:18,537 --> 00:16:21,667
which pretty much makes me
a vegetarian.

221
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,907
But I do love the taste
of a good burger. Mmmm.

222
00:16:24,977 --> 00:16:29,507
You know what they call
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese
in France?

223
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:31,647
- No.
- Tell 'em, Vincent.

224
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:35,747
- A Royale with Cheese.
- A Royale with Cheese.

225
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:39,287
You know why they call it that?

226
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:42,427
Uh, because of
the metric system?

227
00:16:43,497 --> 00:16:46,797
Check out the big brain
on Brett!

228
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:50,207
You're a smart motherfucker.
That's right. The metric system.

229
00:16:52,547 --> 00:16:54,667
- What's in this?
- Sprite.

230
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,677
Sprite. Good.

231
00:16:56,747 --> 00:17:00,617
You mind if I have some of your
tasty beverage to wash this down with?

232
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,547
Go right ahead.

233
00:17:14,997 --> 00:17:17,827
That hit the spot.

234
00:17:17,897 --> 00:17:21,957
You. Flock of Seagulls.
You know why we're here?

235
00:17:22,037 --> 00:17:25,567
- Why don't you tell my man
Vince here where you got the shit hid.
- It's over ―

236
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:29,237
I don't remember askin' you
a goddamned thing!

237
00:17:32,947 --> 00:17:34,747
You were sayin'?

238
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:36,877
It's in the cupboard.

239
00:17:39,657 --> 00:17:42,627
N- No, the one
by your kn-knees.

240
00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:05,797
We happy?

241
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:08,737
Vincent?

242
00:18:08,807 --> 00:18:11,507
- We happy?
- Yeah, we happy.

243
00:18:13,577 --> 00:18:17,877
Look, I'm sorry, uh, I ―
I didn't get your name.

244
00:18:17,947 --> 00:18:21,147
I got yours. Vincent. Right?
B-But I never got yours.

245
00:18:21,217 --> 00:18:26,557
- My name's Pitt, and your ass
ain't talkin' your way outta this shit.
- No, no, no.

246
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:30,967
I just want you
to know how ―

247
00:18:33,597 --> 00:18:37,087
I just want you to know how sorry we are
th-that things got so fucked up ...

248
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:39,367
with us and Mr. Wallace.

249
00:18:39,437 --> 00:18:43,937
W-We got into this thing with
the best intentions. Really. I never ―

250
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:47,407
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I break your concentration?

251
00:18:47,477 --> 00:18:50,077
I didn't mean to do that. Please.

252
00:18:50,147 --> 00:18:55,317
Continue. You were saying something
about "best intentions."

253
00:18:56,727 --> 00:19:00,627
What's the matter?
Oh, you were finished!

254
00:19:00,697 --> 00:19:03,427
Oh, well, allow me to retort.

255
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:09,957
What does Marsellus Wallace
look like?

256
00:19:10,037 --> 00:19:12,227
What?

257
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:15,567
- What country you from?
- What?

258
00:19:15,637 --> 00:19:19,907
- "What" ain't no country I ever
heard of. They speak English in What?
- W-What?

259
00:19:19,977 --> 00:19:22,677
- English, motherfucker!
Do you speak it?
- Yes!

260
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:24,447
- Then you know what I'm sayin'!
- Yes.

261
00:19:24,517 --> 00:19:27,957
Describe what Marsellus Wallace
looks like!

262
00:19:28,017 --> 00:19:30,647
- What? I ―
- Say "what" again!

263
00:19:30,727 --> 00:19:34,657
Say "what" again! I dare ya!
I double dare you, motherfucker!

264
00:19:34,727 --> 00:19:38,627
- Say "what" one more goddamn time!
- H-H-He's black.

265
00:19:38,697 --> 00:19:41,027
- Go on!
- He's bald!

266
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,827
- Does he look like a bitch?
- What?

267
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:49,597
Does he look ... like a bitch?

268
00:19:49,677 --> 00:19:52,907
- No!
- Then why you tryin'
to fuck him like a bitch?

269
00:19:52,977 --> 00:19:56,607
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Brett!

270
00:19:56,687 --> 00:19:58,847
You tried to fuck him.
- No, no.

271
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:04,187
But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be
fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

272
00:20:04,257 --> 00:20:07,317
- You read the Bible, Brett?
- Yes!

273
00:20:07,397 --> 00:20:11,957
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized. Sort of
fits this occasion.

274
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:14,367
Ezekiel 25:17.

275
00:20:14,437 --> 00:20:17,737
"The path of the righteous man ...

276
00:20:17,807 --> 00:20:21,737
is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish ...

277
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:24,747
and the tyranny of evil men.

278
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:29,747
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and goodwill,

279
00:20:29,817 --> 00:20:32,977
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

280
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:35,717
for he is truly
his brother's keeper ...

281
00:20:35,787 --> 00:20:39,337
and the finder of lost children.

282
00:20:39,427 --> 00:20:43,217
And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance ...

283
00:20:43,297 --> 00:20:45,267
and furious anger ...

284
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:49,987
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers!

285
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:53,897
And you will know
My name is the Lord ...

286
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:57,367
when I lay My vengeance
upon thee!"

287
00:21:15,587 --> 00:21:18,247
I think you gonna find ...

288
00:21:18,317 --> 00:21:20,987
when all this shit
is over and done ―

289
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:27,027
I think you're gonna find yourself
one smilin' motherfucker.

290
00:21:28,597 --> 00:21:31,397
The thing is, Butch,

291
00:21:31,467 --> 00:21:34,497
right now ... you got ability.

292
00:21:36,177 --> 00:21:38,607
But painful as it may be,

293
00:21:38,677 --> 00:21:41,837
ability ... don't last.

294
00:21:43,817 --> 00:21:47,907
And your days are just about over.

295
00:21:47,987 --> 00:21:52,387
Now, that's a hard
motherfuckin' fact of life.

296
00:21:52,457 --> 00:21:57,487
But that's a fact of life your ass
is gonna have to get realistic about.

297
00:21:59,397 --> 00:22:04,857
You see, this business is filled to
the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.

298
00:22:04,937 --> 00:22:08,897
Motherfuckers who thought
their ass would age like wine.

299
00:22:10,607 --> 00:22:14,337
If you mean it turns
to vinegar ... it does.

300
00:22:15,577 --> 00:22:19,847
If you mean it gets better
with age ... it don't.

301
00:22:21,517 --> 00:22:23,487
Besides, Butch,

302
00:22:25,217 --> 00:22:28,847
how many fights you think
you got in you anyway?

303
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:31,117
Hmm?

304
00:22:31,197 --> 00:22:33,157
Two?

305
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:37,667
Boxers don't have
an old-timers' day.

306
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:42,757
You came close,
but you never made it.

307
00:22:42,837 --> 00:22:47,037
And if you were gonna make it,
you would have made it before now.

308
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,027
You my nigger?

309
00:23:10,697 --> 00:23:13,097
Certainly appears so.

310
00:23:19,547 --> 00:23:23,467
The night of the fight,
you may feel a slight sting.

311
00:23:26,617 --> 00:23:29,977
That's pride fuckin' with you.

312
00:23:31,057 --> 00:23:33,647
Fuck pride!

313
00:23:35,387 --> 00:23:38,407
Pride only hurts.

314
00:23:38,497 --> 00:23:40,417
It never helps.

315
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:43,887
You fight through that shit.

316
00:23:45,397 --> 00:23:50,307
'Cause a year from now,
when you kickin' it in the Caribbean,

317
00:23:50,377 --> 00:23:55,307
you gonna say to yourself,
"Marsellus Wallace was right."

318
00:23:57,277 --> 00:24:01,547
I got no problem
with that, Mr. Wallace.

319
00:24:01,617 --> 00:24:05,417
In the fifth,
your ass goes down.

320
00:24:09,487 --> 00:24:11,427
Say it.

321
00:24:13,697 --> 00:24:17,127
In the fifth,
my ass goes down.

322
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:21,587
Yo, Vincent Vega.
Our man in Amsterdam.

323
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:26,127
Jules Winfield, our man in lnglewood.
Get your asses on in here.

324
00:24:26,207 --> 00:24:30,037
- Goddamn, nigger,
what's up with them clothes?
- You don't even want to know.

325
00:24:30,107 --> 00:24:33,377
Where's the big man?

326
00:24:33,447 --> 00:24:36,377
The big man's right over there
takin' care of some business.

327
00:24:36,447 --> 00:24:40,907
Why don't you hang back a second or two.
You see the white boy leave, go on over.

328
00:24:43,627 --> 00:24:45,887
How ya been?

329
00:24:45,957 --> 00:24:49,897
- I been doin' pretty good.
How 'bout yourself?
- All right.

330
00:24:51,497 --> 00:24:54,367
So I hear you're
takin' Mia out tomorrow.

331
00:24:57,507 --> 00:24:59,697
At Marsellus's request.

332
00:25:00,977 --> 00:25:03,537
- Have you met Mia?
- Not yet.

333
00:25:03,607 --> 00:25:06,807
What's so fuckin' funny?

334
00:25:06,877 --> 00:25:09,477
- Not a goddamn thing.
- I got to piss.

335
00:25:09,547 --> 00:25:13,817
Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot,
all right? It's the big man's wife.

336
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,547
I'm gonna sit across from her,
chew my food with my mouth closed,

337
00:25:16,627 --> 00:25:18,587
laugh at her fuckin' jokes,
and that's it.

338
00:25:18,657 --> 00:25:21,787
Hey, my name's Paul,
and this shit's between y'all.

339
00:25:21,857 --> 00:25:24,917
Then what'd you fuckin'
ask me about it for?

340
00:25:24,997 --> 00:25:27,487
Asshole.

341
00:25:33,737 --> 00:25:35,937
- Gimme a pack of Red Apples.
- Filters?

342
00:25:36,007 --> 00:25:37,947
No.

343
00:25:40,777 --> 00:25:44,677
- You lookin' at somethin', friend?
- You ain't my friend, palooka.

344
00:25:46,787 --> 00:25:50,277
- What was that?
- I think you heard me just fine, punchy.

345
00:25:50,357 --> 00:25:52,947
Vincent Vega's in the house?

346
00:25:53,027 --> 00:25:56,327
My nigger,
get your ass over here.

347
00:26:03,907 --> 00:26:06,697
- What's up?
- Man, I'm really sorry.

348
00:26:06,777 --> 00:26:08,937
You shouldn't worry about it.

349
00:26:09,007 --> 00:26:11,977
Pack of Red Apples. $1.40.

350
00:26:14,477 --> 00:26:16,817
And some matches.

351
00:26:19,917 --> 00:26:21,857
Thanks.

352
00:26:23,727 --> 00:26:28,047
It's as if it turns every part
of your body into the tip of a penis.

353
00:26:28,127 --> 00:26:32,017
- Whoa.
- I'll lend it to you.
It's a great book on piercing.

354
00:26:32,097 --> 00:26:36,487
That gun to pierce your ears,
they don't use that to pierce
your nipples, do they?

355
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:40,427
Forget that gun. That guns goes against
the entire idea behind piercing.

356
00:26:40,507 --> 00:26:45,377
All my piercing, 18 places on my body,
every one of 'em done with a needle.

357
00:26:45,447 --> 00:26:48,927
Five in each ear, one through
the nipple of my left breast,

358
00:26:49,017 --> 00:26:52,137
two in my right nostril,
one in my left eyebrow,

359
00:26:52,217 --> 00:26:55,077
one in my belly,
one in my lip, one in my clit,

360
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:58,607
and I wear a stud in my tongue.
- Excuse me.

361
00:26:58,687 --> 00:27:00,617
I was just curious,

362
00:27:00,687 --> 00:27:04,547
but, um ... why would you wear
a stud in your tongue?

363
00:27:04,617 --> 00:27:08,117
Sex thing.
Helps fellatio.

364
00:27:08,187 --> 00:27:12,147
Vincenzo.
Step in my office.

365
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:21,997
This is Panda from Mexico.
Very good stuff.

366
00:27:22,067 --> 00:27:25,507
Now, that's Bava.
Different, but equally good.

367
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,507
And that is Choco
from the Harz Mountains of Germany.

368
00:27:28,577 --> 00:27:33,017
Now, the first two are the same.
300 a gram. Those are friend prices.

369
00:27:33,077 --> 00:27:36,047
But this one
is a little more expensive.

370
00:27:36,117 --> 00:27:38,517
This is 500 a gram.

371
00:27:38,587 --> 00:27:41,987
But, when you shoot it, you will know
where that extra money went.

372
00:27:42,057 --> 00:27:46,157
There's nothing wrong with these two.
This is real, real, real good shit.

373
00:27:46,227 --> 00:27:49,887
But this one
is a fuckin' madman.

374
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:52,727
Remember, I just got back
from Amsterdam.

375
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:55,827
Am I a nigger?
Are we in lnglewood? No.

376
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:59,067
You're in my home. Now, white people
who know the difference ...

377
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:02,137
between good shit and bad shit,
this is the house they come to.

378
00:28:02,207 --> 00:28:05,577
Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi
Challenge with that Amsterdam shit ...

379
00:28:05,647 --> 00:28:08,947
any old day of the fuckin' week.
- That's a bold statement.

380
00:28:09,017 --> 00:28:12,887
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.
This is a seller's market.

381
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:16,947
Coke is fuckin' dead
as ... dead.

382
00:28:17,027 --> 00:28:20,897
Heroin, it's comin' back
in a big fuckin' way.

383
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:25,627
- All right.
Gimme three grams of madman.
- Okay.

384
00:28:25,697 --> 00:28:29,137
Now, if it's as good as you say it is,
I'll come back and buy another thousand.

385
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,967
I just hope that I still
have some left for ya,

386
00:28:32,037 --> 00:28:36,237
but I'm givin' you some
out of my own private stash.

387
00:28:36,307 --> 00:28:39,477
That is what a nice guy I am.

388
00:28:39,547 --> 00:28:43,647
- I'm outta balloons.
Is a baggie all right?
- Yeah, that's cool.

389
00:28:43,717 --> 00:28:45,707
All right.
I'll just get one for ya.

390
00:28:45,787 --> 00:28:50,727
Honey, will you get me some baggies
and, uh, twistix from the kitchen?

391
00:28:50,797 --> 00:28:52,757
Okay.

392
00:28:52,827 --> 00:28:56,357
Hey, uh, what do you think about Trudi?
She ain't got a boyfriend.

393
00:28:56,427 --> 00:28:59,727
- You wanna hang out and get high?
- Which one's Trudi?

394
00:28:59,797 --> 00:29:03,967
- The one with all the shit in her face?
- No, that's Jody.

395
00:29:04,037 --> 00:29:06,477
That's my wife.

396
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:11,137
- I'm sorry, man.
- Thank you.

397
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:15,077
- No, I can't. I gotta be someplace.
- All right, no problemo.

398
00:29:15,147 --> 00:29:17,877
I'll take a rain check.

399
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:21,277
- Oh.
- Thank you, Jody.

400
00:29:21,357 --> 00:29:24,657
Still got your Malibu?

401
00:29:24,727 --> 00:29:27,817
Oh, man, you know what some fucker
did the other day?

402
00:29:27,897 --> 00:29:29,827
- What?
- Fuckin' keyed it.

403
00:29:29,897 --> 00:29:33,487
- Oh, man, that's fucked up.
- Tell me about it.

404
00:29:33,567 --> 00:29:36,267
I had it in storage
for three years.

405
00:29:36,337 --> 00:29:40,667
It was out five days, and some
dickless piece of shit fucked with it.

406
00:29:40,747 --> 00:29:45,167
They should be fuckin' killed,
man. No trial, no jury,
straight to execution.

407
00:29:45,247 --> 00:29:49,967
I wish I could've caught him
doin' it. I'd have given
anything to catch that asshole.

408
00:29:50,047 --> 00:29:54,777
- It'd been worth him doin' it
just so I could've caught him.
- What a fucker!

409
00:29:54,857 --> 00:29:57,647
What's more chicken-shit
than fuckin' with a man's automobile?

410
00:29:57,727 --> 00:30:00,617
- Don't fuck with another man's vehicle.
- You don't do it.

411
00:30:00,697 --> 00:30:03,087
- It's just against the rules.
- Thank you.

412
00:30:03,157 --> 00:30:05,317
Thank you.

413
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:08,187
- Mind if I shoot up here?
- Hey, mi casa es su casa.

414
00:30:08,257 --> 00:30:11,557
Muchas gracias.

415
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:58,597
Hi, Vincent.
I'm getting dressed. The door's open.

Where is the intercom?

423
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:33,187
It's on the wall

424

yeah, I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

That's milk and ice cream?

- Sure did.
- How long were you there?

521
00:38:20,267 --> 00:38:22,787
Just over three years.

522
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:28,167
I go there about once a year
to chill out for a month.

Why would you?

00:38:39,647 --> 00:38:41,577
I heard you did a pilot.

526
00:38:42,857 --> 00:38:46,537
- That was my 15 minutes.
- What was it?

527
00:38:46,627 --> 00:38:51,317
It was a show about a team of female
secret agents called Fox Force Five.

528
00:38:51,397 --> 00:38:54,117
- What?
- Fox Force Five.

529
00:38:54,187 --> 00:38:56,447
Fox, as in were a bunch
of foxy chicks.

530
00:38:56,527 --> 00:38:58,987
Force, as in we're a force
to be reckoned with.

531
00:38:59,057 --> 00:39:01,827
And five, as in there's
one-two-three-four-five of us.

532
00:39:01,897 --> 00:39:05,587
There was a blond one,
Sommerset O'Neal. She was the leader.

533
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:08,797
The Japanese fox
was a kung fu master.

534
00:39:08,867 --> 00:39:12,927
The black girl
was a demolition expert.

535
00:39:13,007 --> 00:39:15,877
French fox's speciality was sex.

536
00:39:15,947 --> 00:39:20,307
- What was your speciality?
- Knives.

537
00:39:20,447 --> 00:39:22,417
The character I played,
Raven McCoy,

538
00:39:22,477 --> 00:39:26,347
her background was she grew up
raised by circus performers.

539
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:30,687
According to the show,
she was the deadliest woman
in the world with a knife.

540
00:39:30,757 --> 00:39:33,517
And she knew
a zillion old jokes.

541
00:39:33,587 --> 00:39:37,717
Her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her.

542
00:39:37,797 --> 00:39:41,097
And if we would have got picked up,
they would've worked in a gimmick ...

543
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:45,037
where every show
I would've told another joke.

544
00:39:46,237 --> 00:39:48,997
You know any of them old jokes?

545
00:39:49,077 --> 00:39:52,807
Well, I only got the chance to say one
'cause we only did one show.

546
00:39:52,877 --> 00:39:55,437
- Tell me.
- It's corny.

547
00:39:56,347 --> 00:39:58,437
Don't be that way.
Tell me.

548
00:39:58,517 --> 00:40:02,217
- No, you wouldn't like it,
and I'd be embarrassed.
- You'd be embarr ―

549
00:40:02,287 --> 00:40:06,227
You told 50 million people,
and you can't tell me?

550
00:40:06,287 --> 00:40:10,157
- I promise I won't laugh.
- That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.

551
00:40:10,227 --> 00:40:12,557
That's not what I meant.
You know it.

552
00:40:12,627 --> 00:40:16,067
Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you
'cause it's been built up too much.

Vanilla Coke.

556
00:40:32,087 --> 00:40:35,417
Mmm. Yummy.

557
00:40:35,487 --> 00:40:38,457
You think I could
have a sip of that?

558
00:40:39,987 --> 00:40:42,157
Be my guest.

559
00:40:42,227 --> 00:40:46,257
I gotta know what
a five-dollar shake tastes like.

560
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:49,787
- You can use my straw.
I don't have cooties.
- Yeah, but maybe I do.

561
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:52,737
Cooties I can handle.

562
00:40:52,807 --> 00:40:54,777
All right.

563
00:41:01,847 --> 00:41:04,647
Goddamn, that's a pretty
fuckin' good milkshake!

564
00:41:04,717 --> 00:41:08,777
- Told ya.
- I don't know if it was worth $5,
but it's pretty fuckin' good.

565
00:41:43,707 --> 00:41:47,237
- Don't you hate that?
- Hate what?

566
00:41:47,317 --> 00:41:49,647
Uncomfortable silences.

567
00:41:51,657 --> 00:41:56,177
Why do we feel it's necessary
to yak about bullshit
in order to be comfortable?

568
00:41:56,257 --> 00:42:00,197
I don't know.
That's a good question.

569
00:42:00,257 --> 00:42:04,997
That's when you know
you found somebody really special.

570
00:42:05,067 --> 00:42:09,767
When you can just shut the fuck up for
a minute and comfortably share silence.

571
00:42:09,837 --> 00:42:13,937
Well, I don't think we're quite
there yet, but don't feel bad.
We just met each other.

572
00:42:15,447 --> 00:42:18,567
I'll tell you what.

573
00:42:18,647 --> 00:42:21,907
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
and powder my nose.

574
00:42:21,987 --> 00:42:25,177
You sit here ...
and think of something to say.

575
00:42:26,417 --> 00:42:28,357
I'll do that.

576
00:42:30,687 --> 00:42:32,627
Okay.

577
00:42:57,887 --> 00:43:00,077

578
00:43:00,157 --> 00:43:03,317
Goddamn!
Goddamn.

579
00:43:05,927 --> 00:43:08,517
I need some hair spray.

580
00:43:14,367 --> 00:43:16,357
Mmmm.

581
00:43:16,437 --> 00:43:20,767
Don't you just love it when you
come back from the bathroom to
find your food waiting for you?

582
00:43:20,837 --> 00:43:23,237
We're lucky
we got anything at all.

00:43:23,307 --> 00:43:26,437
I don't think Buddy Holly's
much of a waiter.

584
00:43:26,517 --> 00:43:29,647
Maybe we should've sat
in Marilyn Monroe's section.

585
00:43:29,717 --> 00:43:32,777
- Which one? There's two Monroes.
- No, there's not.

586
00:43:32,857 --> 00:43:35,187
That is Marilyn Monroe.

587
00:43:35,257 --> 00:43:37,987
That is Mamie Van Doren.

588
00:43:38,057 --> 00:43:42,997
I don't see Jayne Mansfield,
so she must have the night off.

589
00:43:43,067 --> 00:43:46,497
- Pretty smart.
- Yeah. I got my moments.

590
00:43:46,567 --> 00:43:50,937
- So did you think of somethin' to say?
- Actually, I did.

591
00:43:52,577 --> 00:43:54,537
However ...

592
00:43:56,247 --> 00:43:59,267
you seem like
a really nice person, and I ―

593
00:43:59,347 --> 00:44:02,177
I don't want to offend you.
- Oooh.

594
00:44:02,247 --> 00:44:07,447
This doesn't sound like
the usual, mindless, boring,
gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.

595
00:44:07,517 --> 00:44:10,517
This sounds like you
actually have somethin' to say.

596
00:44:10,587 --> 00:44:13,427
Well, well, I do. I do.

597
00:44:13,497 --> 00:44:17,557
- But you have
to promise not to be offended.
- No, no.

598
00:44:17,637 --> 00:44:21,857
You can't promise somethin' like that.
I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.

599
00:44:21,937 --> 00:44:26,807
You can ask me what you're gonna
ask me, and my natural response
could be to get offended.

600
00:44:26,877 --> 00:44:29,227
Then, through no fault of my own,
I would have broken my promise.

601
00:44:29,307 --> 00:44:32,007
- Let's just forget it.
- That's an impossibility.

602
00:44:32,077 --> 00:44:36,127
Trying to forget anything
as intriguing as this would be
an exercise in futility.

603
00:44:36,217 --> 00:44:38,407
- Is that a fact?
- And besides,

604
00:44:38,487 --> 00:44:43,507
isn't it more, uh, exciting
when you don't have permission?
- All right, all right.

605
00:44:43,587 --> 00:44:46,377
Well, here goes.

606
00:44:46,447 --> 00:44:49,477
What did you think about
what happened to Antwan?

607
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:52,987
- Who's Antwan?
- Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.

608
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:56,287
- He fell out of a window.
- Hmm. Hmm.

609
00:44:56,357 --> 00:45:01,057
Well, that is one way to say it.
Another way to say it would be
that he was thrown out.

610
00:45:01,137 --> 00:45:04,297
Another way would be
he was thrown out by Marsellus.

611
00:45:04,367 --> 00:45:09,497
Yet even another way is to say
he was thrown out of a window
by Marsellus because of you.

612
00:45:09,577 --> 00:45:12,007
- Is that a fact?
- No.

613
00:45:12,077 --> 00:45:15,207
No, it's not a fact. It's just what
I heard. That's just what I heard.

614
00:45:15,277 --> 00:45:18,177
- Who told you?
- They.

615
00:45:18,247 --> 00:45:20,717
"They" talk a lot, don't they?

616
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:25,547
They certainly do.
They certainly do.

617
00:45:25,627 --> 00:45:30,027
- Don't be shy, Vincent.
What else did "they" say?
- I'm- I'm not shy.

618
00:45:30,097 --> 00:45:32,617
- Um ―
- Did it involve the "F" word?

619
00:45:32,697 --> 00:45:36,687
No, no, no, no, no.
They just said that Antwan
had given you a foot massage.

620
00:45:38,237 --> 00:45:40,867
- And?
- And ― And nothin'.

621
00:45:40,937 --> 00:45:43,807
That's it.

622
00:45:43,877 --> 00:45:45,937
You heard Marsellus ...

623
00:45:46,007 --> 00:45:50,377
threw Tony Rocky Horror
out of a fourth-story window
for giving me a foot massage?

624
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:52,387
- Mm-hmm.
- And you believe that?

625
00:45:52,447 --> 00:45:56,977
Well, at the time
I was told it sounded reasonable.

626
00:45:57,057 --> 00:46:00,147
Marsellus throwing Tony out
of a fourth-story window ...

627
00:46:00,227 --> 00:46:03,287
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable?

628
00:46:03,357 --> 00:46:06,817
No, it seemed excessive,
but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

629
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:09,557
I understand that Marsellus
is very protective of you.

630
00:46:09,637 --> 00:46:14,267
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

631
00:46:14,337 --> 00:46:18,067
A husband almost killing
another man for touching
his wife's feet is something else.

632
00:46:18,147 --> 00:46:20,737
But did it happen?

633
00:46:20,807 --> 00:46:26,647
Only thing Antwan ever touched
of mine was my hand when he
shook it ... at my wedding.

634
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:29,117
Really?

635
00:46:29,187 --> 00:46:32,517
Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus
threw Tony out that window ...

636
00:46:32,587 --> 00:46:34,527
except Marsellus and Tony.

637
00:46:34,597 --> 00:46:38,587
When you little scamps get together,
you're worse than a sewing circle.

638
00:46:38,727 --> 00:46:42,597
Ladies and gentlemen. Now the moment
you've all been waiting for.

639
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:47,697
The world-famous
Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.

640
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:54,437
Now, this is where
one lucky couple ...

641
00:46:54,517 --> 00:46:58,977
will win this handsome trophy
that Marilyn here is holding.

642
00:46:59,047 --> 00:47:02,607
Now, who will be
our first contestants?

643
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:04,947
- Right here!
- All right!

644
00:47:05,027 --> 00:47:08,037
- I wanna dance.
- No, no, no, no, no.

645
00:47:08,127 --> 00:47:12,857
No, no, no, no, no. I do believe
Marsellus, my husband, your boss,

646
00:47:12,927 --> 00:47:16,357
told you to take me out
and do whatever I wanted.

647
00:47:16,437 --> 00:47:20,117
Now I wanna dance;
I wanna win; I want that trophy.

648
00:47:20,207 --> 00:47:22,747
- So dance good.
- All right. You asked for it.

649
00:47:22,817 --> 00:47:25,777
Let's hear it
for our first contestants.

650
00:47:30,387 --> 00:47:35,657
Now let's meet our first
contestants here this evening.
Young lady, what is your name?

651
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,707
Mrs. Mia Wallace.

00:47:37,797 --> 00:47:40,417
And how 'bout your fella here?

653
00:47:40,487 --> 00:47:42,317
Vincent Vega.

654
00:47:42,387 --> 00:47:45,827
All right, let's see what you can do.
Take it away!

655
00:47:45,907 --> 00:47:48,827

Don't fuckin' die on me, Mia!

731
00:55:00,187 --> 00:55:02,127
Fuck!

732
00:55:09,297 --> 00:55:11,237
Answer.

733
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:13,737
Have you got the ring?

734
00:55:13,807 --> 00:55:17,637
- Why, certainly.
- Join hands, you two lovebirds.

735
00:55:17,707 --> 00:55:20,147
Please! Please!

736
00:55:20,207 --> 00:55:22,877
Yes, yes.
Hold hands, you lovebirds.

737
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:31,277
Fuck you, Lance!
Answer!

738
00:55:36,357 --> 00:55:38,297
Now what do you say?

739
00:55:38,367 --> 00:55:41,297
I give up!
I'll marry you!

740
00:55:41,367 --> 00:55:46,027
- Lance!
The goddamn phone's ringing!

741
00:55:47,737 --> 00:55:49,677
I can hear it.

742
00:55:49,737 --> 00:55:53,177
I thought you told those
fuckin' assholes never to
call here this late!

743
00:55:53,247 --> 00:55:55,177
Yeah, I told them.

744
00:55:55,247 --> 00:55:58,507
And that is exactly what I'm going
to tell this fucking asshole right now.

745
00:56:00,087 --> 00:56:02,917
- Don't you dare strike me!
- Hello.

746
00:56:02,987 --> 00:56:05,247
Lance! Vincent.

747
00:56:05,327 --> 00:56:08,257
I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man.
I'm coming to your house.

748
00:56:08,327 --> 00:56:12,407
W-Whoa. Whoa. Hold your horses, man.
W-What's the problem?

749
00:56:12,497 --> 00:56:15,747
- I got this chick,
she's fuckin' O.D.in' on me!
- Well, don't bring her here!

750
00:56:15,837 --> 00:56:20,157
I'm not even joking with you!
Do not be bringing some
fucked-up pooh-bah to my house!

751
00:56:20,237 --> 00:56:22,287
- No choice.
- Wh ― She's O.D.in'?

752
00:56:22,377 --> 00:56:25,557
- She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man!
- Just dandy.

753
00:56:25,647 --> 00:56:29,827
Okay, then you bite
the fuckin' bullet, take her
to a hospital and call a lawyer.

754
00:56:29,917 --> 00:56:32,337
- Negative!
- This is not my fuckin' problem, man!

755
00:56:32,417 --> 00:56:36,137
You fucked her up,
you fuckin' deal with this!

756
00:56:36,217 --> 00:56:39,047
Uh, are you talkin' to me
on a cellular phone?

757
00:56:39,117 --> 00:56:41,547
I don't know you.
Who is this? Don't come here!

758
00:56:41,627 --> 00:56:44,947
I'm hanging up the phone!
Prank caller! Prank caller!

759
00:56:53,027 --> 00:56:55,967
What the hell was that?

760
00:56:57,927 --> 00:57:00,367
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

761
00:57:00,437 --> 00:57:03,367
- You were talking about drug
shit on a cellular phone!
- Lance, help me.

762
00:57:03,437 --> 00:57:06,377
- You crashed your car
into my fucking house!
- Grab her feet.

763
00:57:06,437 --> 00:57:09,877
Are you deaf? You are not bringing
this fucked-up bitch into my house!

764
00:57:09,947 --> 00:57:12,877
This "fucked-up bitch"
is Marsellus Wallace's wife.

765
00:57:12,947 --> 00:57:15,377
- Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is?
- Yeah.

766
00:57:15,447 --> 00:57:18,387
If she croaks on me,
I am a fucking grease spot!

767
00:57:18,457 --> 00:57:23,047
I will be forced to tell him
that you did not help and
let her die on your lawn.

768
00:57:23,127 --> 00:57:26,057
Now, come on. Help me, help me.
Pick her up.

769
00:57:27,127 --> 00:57:29,057
Shit.

770
00:57:31,127 --> 00:57:33,497
Lance!

771
00:57:33,567 --> 00:57:35,497
Shit.

772
00:57:35,567 --> 00:57:38,007
It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.

773
00:57:38,077 --> 00:57:41,407
What the fuck's going on out here?

774
00:57:41,477 --> 00:57:43,407
Who's she?

775
00:57:43,477 --> 00:57:46,417
Go to the fridge and get the thing
with the adrenalin shot.

776
00:57:46,477 --> 00:57:48,537
- What's wrong with her?
- She's O.D.ing!

777
00:57:48,617 --> 00:57:50,677
- Get her outta here!
- Get the shot!

778
00:57:50,747 --> 00:57:54,277
- Fuck you! Fuck you too!
- What a fuckin' bitch.

779
00:57:54,357 --> 00:57:56,287
Just keep talking to her,
all right?

780
00:57:56,357 --> 00:57:59,287
She's gettin' the shot. I'm going
to go get my little black medical book.

781
00:57:59,357 --> 00:58:01,347
What the fuck you need
a medical book for?

782
00:58:01,427 --> 00:58:03,367
I've never had to give
an adrenalin shot before!

783
00:58:03,427 --> 00:58:06,867
I don't go joy-poppin'
with bubble-gummers!
My friends can handle their highs!

784
00:58:06,937 --> 00:58:09,367
- Get the shot!
- I am, if you'll let me!

785
00:58:09,437 --> 00:58:12,367
- I ain't stopping you!
- Stop talking to me.
Start talking to her!

786
00:58:12,437 --> 00:58:14,377
- Get the shot!
- All right!

787
00:58:17,547 --> 00:58:20,977
- Hurry up. We're losing her!
- I'm looking as fast as I can!

788
00:58:21,047 --> 00:58:22,987
What's he looking for?

789
00:58:23,047 --> 00:58:25,987
- I don't know. Some book.
- What are you looking for?

790
00:58:26,057 --> 00:58:28,987
- A little black medical book.
- What are you looking for?

791
00:58:29,057 --> 00:58:33,157
My little black medical book! It's
like a textbook they give to nurses.

792
00:58:33,227 --> 00:58:36,167
- I never saw no medical book.
- Trust me. I have one.

793
00:58:36,227 --> 00:58:39,167
- If it's so important,
why don't you keep it with the shot?
- I don't know!

794
00:58:39,237 --> 00:58:43,167
- Stop bothering me!
- While you're looking, that girl's
gonna die on our carpet.

795
00:58:43,237 --> 00:58:45,167
You're never gonna find
anything in this mess!

796
00:58:45,237 --> 00:58:49,137
- I'm gonna fucking kill you
if you don't shut up!
- Lance, get in here!

797
00:58:49,207 --> 00:58:53,437
- Right? Pig.
- Get the fuck outta my way.

798
00:58:53,517 --> 00:58:56,947
- Quit fuckin' around
and give her the shot.
- While I'm doing this,

799
00:58:57,017 --> 00:59:00,347
you take off her shirt
and find her heart.

800
00:59:00,417 --> 00:59:03,967
- Does it gotta be exact?
- We're giving her a shot in the heart,
so it's gotta be exact.

801
00:59:04,057 --> 00:59:06,997
I don't know exactly where her heart is.
I think it's right here.

802
00:59:07,057 --> 00:59:10,717
- That's it.
- All right, what I need is
a big, fat magic marker.

803
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,727
- You got it?
- What?

804
00:59:12,797 --> 00:59:15,497
A magic marker.
A felt pen!

805
00:59:15,567 --> 00:59:18,187
A fuckin' black magic marker!
Christ.

806
00:59:18,277 --> 00:59:23,327
- Come on, man. Hurry up!
- Fuck! Okay, okay.
Okay. I think it's ready.

807
00:59:26,517 --> 00:59:29,007
- Hurry up, man.
- I'll tell you what to do.

808
00:59:29,087 --> 00:59:32,007
- You're gonna give her the shot.
- No, you're gonna give her the shot.

809
00:59:32,087 --> 00:59:35,007
- I ain't giving her the shot.
I never done this before.
- I never done this either!

810
00:59:35,087 --> 00:59:38,067
I ain't starting now!
You brought her here.
You give her the shot.

811
00:59:38,147 --> 00:59:41,547
The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch
to your house, then I give her the shot.

812
00:59:41,627 --> 00:59:43,557
Give it to me.
Give me that.

813
00:59:43,627 --> 00:59:46,557
All right, tell me what to do.

814
00:59:46,627 --> 00:59:49,617
Okay, you're giving her an injection
of adrenalin straight to her heart.

815
00:59:49,697 --> 00:59:52,627
- But she's got a breastplate ―
You gotta pierce through that.

816
00:59:52,697 --> 00:59:55,627
You gotta bring the needle
down in a stabbing motion.

817
00:59:55,697 --> 00:59:59,137
- I gotta- I gotta
stab her three times?
- No, just stab her once!

818
00:59:59,207 --> 01:00:02,637
But it's gotta be hard enough to get
through her breastplate into her heart.

819
01:00:02,707 --> 01:00:05,637
Once you do that,
you p-press down on the p-plunger.

820
01:00:05,707 --> 01:00:08,197
- Okay. Then what happens?
- Kinda curious about that myself.

821
01:00:08,277 --> 01:00:11,217
This ain't no fuckin' joke!
Am I gonna kill her?

822
01:00:11,277 --> 01:00:14,717
- She's supposed to come out
of it like that. It's ―
- All right, count to three.

823
01:00:14,787 --> 01:00:16,977
- All right. Ready?
- One.

824
01:00:22,257 --> 01:00:23,787
Two.

825
01:00:31,767 --> 01:00:33,737
Three!

826
01:00:48,317 --> 01:00:51,587
If you're all right,
then say something.

827
01:00:51,657 --> 01:00:54,677
Something.

828
01:00:54,757 --> 01:00:56,697
That was fuckin' trippy.

829
01:00:59,267 --> 01:01:02,597
- Ohh.
- Oh, man.

830
01:01:27,287 --> 01:01:29,227
Mia. Mia.

831
01:01:31,397 --> 01:01:33,827
What's ―

832
01:01:33,897 --> 01:01:36,697
What's your thoughts on ― on ―

833
01:01:36,767 --> 01:01:38,797
on how to handle this?

834
01:01:38,867 --> 01:01:40,807
What's yours?

835
01:01:43,877 --> 01:01:47,777
Well, I'm of the opinion
that if Marsellus lived his whole life,

836
01:01:47,847 --> 01:01:51,847
he doesn't need to know
nothing about this incident.

837
01:01:51,977 --> 01:01:54,777
If Marsellus knew
about this incident,

838
01:01:54,847 --> 01:01:56,907
I'd be in as much trouble as you.

839
01:01:56,977 --> 01:01:59,477
I seriously doubt that.

840
01:01:59,547 --> 01:02:02,487
I can keep a secret if you can.

841
01:02:04,527 --> 01:02:06,457
Shake on it?

842
01:02:11,667 --> 01:02:13,957
Mum's the word?

843
01:02:14,027 --> 01:02:15,957
Cool.

844
01:02:16,037 --> 01:02:20,357
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going
to go home and have a heart attack.

845
01:02:23,107 --> 01:02:25,027
Vincent.

846
01:02:26,907 --> 01:02:29,927
Do you wanna hear
my Fox Force Five joke?

847
01:02:31,017 --> 01:02:32,937
Sure.

848
01:02:33,017 --> 01:02:36,037
Except I think I'm still
a little too petrified to laugh.

849
01:02:36,107 --> 01:02:39,047
No, you won't laugh
'cause it's not funny.

850
01:02:39,127 --> 01:02:42,447
But if you still wanna hear it,
I'll tell it.

851
01:02:42,527 --> 01:02:44,707
- I can't wait.
- Okay.

852
01:02:44,787 --> 01:02:47,657
Three tomatoes
are walkin' down the street.

853
01:02:47,717 --> 01:02:50,157
Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato
and Baby Tomato.

854
01:02:50,227 --> 01:02:54,387
Baby Tomato starts lagging behind,
and Papa Tomato gets really angry.

855
01:02:54,457 --> 01:02:57,397
Goes back and squishes him
and says,

856
01:02:57,467 --> 01:02:59,557
"Ketchup."

857
01:03:02,407 --> 01:03:04,337
Ketchup.

858
01:03:08,477 --> 01:03:10,607
See you around.

859
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:35,367
Oh, that Paddlefoot.
He funny, silly dog.

860
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:38,367
He think totem pole alive!

861
01:03:38,437 --> 01:03:41,167
He arctic tenderfoot!

862
01:03:41,237 --> 01:03:44,907
That totem pole been here forever!

863
01:03:44,977 --> 01:03:46,917
Butch?

864
01:03:46,977 --> 01:03:49,847
One more thing, 
and we'll start for ―

865
01:03:49,917 --> 01:03:52,857
- Butch, stop watching TV for a second.
- Yeah?

866
01:03:52,917 --> 01:03:56,547
- You've got a special visitor.
- Stand up. Stand up.

867
01:03:59,327 --> 01:04:04,267
Now, do you remember when I told you
your daddy died in a P.O.W. camp?

868
01:04:04,327 --> 01:04:08,067
Well, this here is Captain Koons.

869
01:04:08,137 --> 01:04:11,067
He was in the P.O.W. camp
with Daddy.

870
01:04:16,407 --> 01:04:18,347
Hello, little man.

871
01:04:18,417 --> 01:04:22,507
Boy, I sure heard
a bunch about you.

872
01:04:22,587 --> 01:04:25,817
See, I was a good friend
of your dad's.

873
01:04:25,887 --> 01:04:28,917
We were in that Hanoi
pit of hell together ...

874
01:04:28,987 --> 01:04:31,457
over five years.

875
01:04:31,527 --> 01:04:33,457
Hopefully ...

876
01:04:33,527 --> 01:04:36,467
you'll never have to
experience this yourself,

877
01:04:36,527 --> 01:04:39,967
but when two men are in a situation
like me and your dad were ...

878
01:04:40,037 --> 01:04:42,837
for as long as we were,

879
01:04:42,907 --> 01:04:47,207
you take on certain responsibilities
of the other.

880
01:04:47,277 --> 01:04:49,207
If it'd been me who'd ―

881
01:04:50,547 --> 01:04:52,477
not made it,

882
01:04:52,547 --> 01:04:56,817
Major Coolidge'd be talking right now
to my son Jim.

883
01:04:56,887 --> 01:05:00,547
But the way it turned out,
I'm talking to you.

884
01:05:01,957 --> 01:05:03,887
Butch ...

885
01:05:05,427 --> 01:05:07,357
I got something for ya.

886
01:05:13,867 --> 01:05:15,927
This watch I got here ...

887
01:05:16,007 --> 01:05:20,797
was first purchased
by your great-grandfather
during the first World War.

888
01:05:20,877 --> 01:05:25,537
It was bought in a little general store
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

889
01:05:25,617 --> 01:05:29,167
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

890
01:05:29,247 --> 01:05:32,177
Up 'til then, people just
carried pocket watches.

891
01:05:32,257 --> 01:05:35,407
It was bought
by Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge ...

892
01:05:35,477 --> 01:05:38,417
on the day he set sail for Paris.

893
01:05:38,497 --> 01:05:40,917
This was your
great-grandfather's war watch,

894
01:05:40,997 --> 01:05:44,347
and he wore it every day
he was in that war, and ...

895
01:05:44,417 --> 01:05:47,987
when he'd done his duty,
he went home to your great-grandmother,

896
01:05:48,057 --> 01:05:52,497
took the watch off,
put it in an old coffee can,
and in that can it stayed ...

897
01:05:52,567 --> 01:05:56,997
until your granddad, Dane Coolidge,
was called upon by his country ...

898
01:05:57,067 --> 01:06:00,797
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

899
01:06:00,867 --> 01:06:04,327
This time they called it
World War II.

900
01:06:04,407 --> 01:06:09,407
Your great-grandfather gave this watch
to your granddad for good luck.

901
01:06:09,477 --> 01:06:12,477
Unfortunately, Dane's luck
wasn't as good as his old man's.

902
01:06:12,547 --> 01:06:15,487
Dane was a Marine,
and he was killed ...

903
01:06:15,557 --> 01:06:19,577
along with all the other Marines
at the battle of Wake lsland.

904
01:06:19,657 --> 01:06:22,587
Your granddad was facing death.

905
01:06:22,657 --> 01:06:24,597
He knew it.

906
01:06:24,657 --> 01:06:28,597
None of those boys ever
had any illusions about
leaving that island alive,

907
01:06:28,667 --> 01:06:31,867
so three days before the Japanese
took the island,

908
01:06:31,937 --> 01:06:37,167
your granddad asked
a gunner on an Air Force transport,
name of Winocki ―

909
01:06:37,237 --> 01:06:40,177
a man he'd never met before
in his life ―

910
01:06:40,247 --> 01:06:43,217
to deliver to his infant son,

911
01:06:43,277 --> 01:06:47,877
who he'd never seen in the flesh,
his gold watch.

912
01:06:47,947 --> 01:06:52,287
Three days later, your granddad
was dead, but Winocki kept his word.

913
01:06:52,357 --> 01:06:56,627
After the war was over,
he paid a visit to your grandmother,

914
01:06:56,697 --> 01:07:00,927
delivering to your infant father
his dad's gold watch.

915
01:07:00,997 --> 01:07:02,937
This watch.

916
01:07:08,807 --> 01:07:14,247
This watch was on your daddy's wrist
when he was shot down over Hanoi.

917
01:07:14,307 --> 01:07:17,747
He was captured,
put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

918
01:07:17,817 --> 01:07:21,877
He knew if the gooks
ever saw the watch,

919
01:07:21,957 --> 01:07:25,477
it'd be confiscated,
taken away.

920
01:07:25,557 --> 01:07:29,257
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

921
01:07:29,327 --> 01:07:33,267
He'd be damned if any slope's
gonna put their greasy, yellow
hands on his boy's birthright,

922
01:07:33,327 --> 01:07:37,267
so he hid it in one place he knew
he could hide something ― his ass.

923
01:07:37,337 --> 01:07:40,767
Five long years
he wore this watch up his ass.

924
01:07:40,837 --> 01:07:45,037
Then he died of dysentery ―
He give me the watch.

925
01:07:45,107 --> 01:07:48,977
I hid this uncomfortable
hunk of metal up my ass two years.

926
01:07:49,047 --> 01:07:50,977
Then ...

927
01:07:51,047 --> 01:07:55,107
after seven years,
I was sent home to my family and ...

928
01:07:55,187 --> 01:07:57,117
now ...

929
01:07:59,557 --> 01:08:02,487
little man,
I give the watch to you.

930
01:08:25,347 --> 01:08:27,277
It's time, Butch.

931
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:37,947
ln the heavyweight division,

932
01:08:38,017 --> 01:08:41,177
in the right corner
wearing the blue trunks,

933
01:08:41,257 --> 01:08:44,517
weighing 210 pounds,

934
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:47,717
Floyd Ray Wilson!

935
01:08:50,797 --> 01:08:52,727
It's official. It's official.

936
01:08:52,797 --> 01:08:55,737
- Wilson is dead!
- Well, Dan,
that had to be the bloodiest,

937
01:08:55,807 --> 01:08:58,237
hands down, the most brutal fight
this city's ever seen.

938
01:08:58,307 --> 01:09:01,897
Coolidge was out of there
faster than I've ever seen
a victorious boxer leave the ring.

939
01:09:01,977 --> 01:09:04,907
- Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?
- My guess would be yes.

940
01:09:04,977 --> 01:09:08,417
I could see the frenzy in his
eyes give way to the realization
of what he was doing.

941
01:09:08,487 --> 01:09:11,917
- I think any man would've
left the ring that fast.
- Do you feel this tragedy ...

942
01:09:11,987 --> 01:09:13,917
is gonna affect
the world of boxing?

943
01:09:13,987 --> 01:09:17,927
A tragedy like this can't help
but shake the world of boxing
to its very foundations.

944
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:21,927
It's of paramount importance,
during the sad weeks ahead,
the eyes of the W.B.A. remain ―

945
01:09:56,767 --> 01:09:59,097
Man, you know I didn't ―

946
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:02,097
- Marsellus.
- No, it wasn't. I didn't do it.

947
01:10:02,167 --> 01:10:04,107
I didn't do it.

948
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:06,667
- How you doing?
- Great.

949
01:10:06,737 --> 01:10:09,177
I never thanked you
for dinner.

950
01:10:11,077 --> 01:10:13,017
- What you got?
- He booked.

951
01:10:13,077 --> 01:10:16,177
- His trainer?
- Says he don't know nothin'.
I believe him.

952
01:10:16,247 --> 01:10:19,687
- I think Butch surprised
his ass same as us.
- No, we don't wanna "think."

953
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:23,347
We wanna know. Take him to
the kennel, sic the dogs on his ass.

954
01:10:23,427 --> 01:10:26,857
We'll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don't.

955
01:10:26,927 --> 01:10:28,857
Butch's search ―
How do you want it done?

956
01:10:28,927 --> 01:10:31,867
I'm prepared to scour the Earth
for that motherfucker.

957
01:10:31,937 --> 01:10:35,367
If Butch goes to Indochina, I want
a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice ...

958
01:10:35,437 --> 01:10:37,567
ready to pop a cap in his ass.

959
01:10:37,637 --> 01:10:39,777
I will take care of it.

960
01:10:49,517 --> 01:10:51,887
Mister.

961
01:10:54,787 --> 01:10:57,277
- Hey, mister.
- What?

962
01:10:57,357 --> 01:11:02,157
You were in that fight,
the fight on the radio.

963
01:11:02,227 --> 01:11:05,667
- You're the fighter?
- Whatever gave you that idea?

964
01:11:05,737 --> 01:11:08,497
No, come on.

965
01:11:08,567 --> 01:11:10,507
You're him.

966
01:11:10,577 --> 01:11:13,007
I know you're him.

967
01:11:14,747 --> 01:11:16,637
Tell me you're him.

968
01:11:16,707 --> 01:11:18,647
I'm him.

969
01:11:19,747 --> 01:11:22,177
You killed the other boxing man.

970
01:11:25,817 --> 01:11:27,907
He's dead?

971
01:11:27,977 --> 01:11:30,417
The radio said he was dead.

972
01:11:33,197 --> 01:11:35,417
Sorry about that, Floyd.

973
01:11:36,717 --> 01:11:39,217
What does it feel like?

974
01:11:39,287 --> 01:11:41,227
What does what feel like?

975
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,227
Killing a man.

976
01:11:44,997 --> 01:11:49,057
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands.

977
01:11:49,137 --> 01:11:51,067
What are you, a weirdo?

978
01:11:51,137 --> 01:11:53,067
No.

979
01:11:53,137 --> 01:11:56,577
It is a subject
I have much interest in.

980
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:02,077
You are the first person
I have ever met who has killed somebody.

981
01:12:04,587 --> 01:12:07,017
So?

982
01:12:07,087 --> 01:12:10,347
What does it feel like to kill a man?

983
01:12:11,457 --> 01:12:13,387
I'll tell you what.

984
01:12:13,457 --> 01:12:17,397
Give me one of them cigarettes
you got up there, and I'll
tell you all about it.

985
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:38,347
So, Esmarelda ...

986
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:43,057
Villa Lobos ―
Is that Mexican?

987
01:12:43,117 --> 01:12:46,357
The name is Spanish,
but I am Colombian.

988
01:12:46,427 --> 01:12:49,727
- That's some handle
you got there, honey.
- Thank you.

989
01:12:49,797 --> 01:12:51,727
And what is your name?

990
01:12:51,797 --> 01:12:53,487
Butch.

991
01:12:53,567 --> 01:12:56,037
Butch.

992
01:12:56,097 --> 01:13:00,867
- What does it mean?
- I'm an American, honey.
Our names don't mean shit.

993
01:13:00,937 --> 01:13:03,597
So, moving right along,

994
01:13:03,677 --> 01:13:05,607
Esmarelda,

995
01:13:05,677 --> 01:13:07,937
what is it you want to know?

996
01:13:08,017 --> 01:13:12,877
- I want to know what it
feels like to kill a man.
- I couldn't tell ya.

997
01:13:18,787 --> 01:13:23,227
Didn't know he was dead
'til you told me he was dead.

998
01:13:23,297 --> 01:13:27,887
Now that I know he's dead,
you wanna know how I feel about it?

999
01:13:31,637 --> 01:13:35,077
I don't feel
the least bit bad about it.

1000
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:48,487
What the fuck'd I tell ya?
Huh?

1001
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:52,487
As soon as the word got out
the fix was in, man, the odds
went through the roof.

1002
01:13:52,557 --> 01:13:54,757
I know. I know.
Unbelievable.

1003
01:13:54,827 --> 01:13:58,257
Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was
a better boxer, he'd still be alive.

1004
01:13:58,327 --> 01:14:00,267
If he never
laced up his gloves,

1005
01:14:00,327 --> 01:14:02,767
which he never shoulda done in the first
fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.

1006
01:14:04,837 --> 01:14:08,417
Yeah, well, who gives a fuck?
It's over now.

1007
01:14:08,507 --> 01:14:11,427
Yeah, well, enough about the poor,
unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

1008
01:14:11,507 --> 01:14:15,197
Let's talk about the rich
and prosperous Mr. Butch.

1009
01:14:15,277 --> 01:14:18,217
How many bookies did you
lay it around on?

1010
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,717
All eight?
How long to collect?

1011
01:14:22,357 --> 01:14:25,277
So you'll have it all
by tomorrow night? No, I understand.

1012
01:14:25,347 --> 01:14:28,507
A few stragglers aside.
Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.

1013
01:14:28,587 --> 01:14:30,817
That is great news, man.

1014
01:14:30,887 --> 01:14:35,087
Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, me and Fabienne
are gonna leave in the morning.

1015
01:14:35,157 --> 01:14:38,417
It'll probably take us
a couple days to get down to Knoxville.

1016
01:14:38,497 --> 01:14:40,427
Okay, my brother.

1017
01:14:40,497 --> 01:14:42,467
You're right.

1018
01:14:42,527 --> 01:14:44,867
You're goddamn right.

1019
01:14:44,937 --> 01:14:48,427
All right, Scotty, next time I see you,
it'll be on Tennessee time.

1020
01:14:48,507 --> 01:14:50,837
Cool, brother.

1021
01:15:05,987 --> 01:15:08,417
$45.60.

1022
01:15:11,997 --> 01:15:13,927
And, uh,

1023
01:15:13,997 --> 01:15:17,297
here's a little something
for the effort.

1024
01:15:17,367 --> 01:15:21,297
Now, if anybody asks you who your fare
was tonight, what are you gonna say?

1025
01:15:21,367 --> 01:15:23,307
The truth.

1026
01:15:23,367 --> 01:15:26,867
Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted Mexicans.

1027
01:15:28,777 --> 01:15:31,177
Bonsoir,
Esmarelda Villa Lobos.

1028
01:15:31,247 --> 01:15:33,767
Buenas Noches, Butch.

1029
01:15:44,897 --> 01:15:46,827
Whew.

1030
01:15:48,197 --> 01:15:50,187
Keep the light off.

1031
01:15:50,267 --> 01:15:53,197
- Is that better, Sugar Pop?
- Oui.

1032
01:15:57,677 --> 01:15:59,607
Hard day at the office?

1033
01:15:59,677 --> 01:16:01,607
Pretty hard.

1034
01:16:01,677 --> 01:16:03,907
Got in a fight.

1035
01:16:03,977 --> 01:16:06,137
Poor baby.

1036
01:16:06,217 --> 01:16:08,777
Can you make spoons?

1037
01:16:08,847 --> 01:16:11,787
You know what?
I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.

1038
01:16:11,857 --> 01:16:15,787
- I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.
- I like the way you stink.

1039
01:16:15,857 --> 01:16:18,287
Let me take this jacket off.

1040
01:16:20,457 --> 01:16:23,987
- I was looking at myself in the mirror.
- Uh-huh.

1041
01:16:24,067 --> 01:16:25,997
I wish I had a pot.

1042
01:16:27,767 --> 01:16:31,707
You were looking
at yourself in the mirror,
and you wish you had some pot?

1043
01:16:31,777 --> 01:16:34,707
A pot.
A pot belly.

1044
01:16:34,777 --> 01:16:36,937
Pot bellies are sexy.

1045
01:16:37,007 --> 01:16:39,307
Well, you should be happy,

1046
01:16:39,377 --> 01:16:41,317
'cause you have one.

1047
01:16:41,387 --> 01:16:44,837
Shut up, fatso.
I don't have a pot.

1048
01:16:44,917 --> 01:16:48,787
I have a bit of a tummy,
like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star."

1049
01:16:48,857 --> 01:16:50,787
It's not the same thing.

1050
01:16:50,857 --> 01:16:54,787
I didn't know there was
such a difference between
a pot belly and a tummy.

1051
01:16:54,867 --> 01:16:56,797
The difference is huge.

1052
01:16:56,867 --> 01:17:00,287
Would you like it if I had a pot belly?

1053
01:17:00,367 --> 01:17:02,307
No.

1054
01:17:02,367 --> 01:17:06,797
Pot bellies make a man
look either oafish or like a gorilla.

1055
01:17:06,877 --> 01:17:09,957
But on a woman
a pot belly's very sexy.

1056
01:17:10,047 --> 01:17:15,477
The rest of you is normal ― normal face,
normal legs, normal hips, normal ass ―

1057
01:17:15,547 --> 01:17:19,597
but with a big,
perfectly round pot belly.

1058
01:17:19,687 --> 01:17:22,617
If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt
two sizes too small ...

1059
01:17:22,687 --> 01:17:24,617
to accentuate it.

1060
01:17:24,687 --> 01:17:27,117
You think men
would find that attractive?

1061
01:17:27,187 --> 01:17:30,347
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.

1062
01:17:30,427 --> 01:17:33,877
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing
to the touch and pleasing to the eye ...

1063
01:17:33,967 --> 01:17:35,897
is seldom the same.

1064
01:17:39,297 --> 01:17:42,897
If you had a pot belly,
I would punch you in it.

1065
01:17:42,967 --> 01:17:45,907
- You'd punch me in the belly?
- Right in the belly.

1066
01:17:45,967 --> 01:17:47,907
Ohh! I'd smother you!

1067
01:17:47,977 --> 01:17:51,907
I'd drop it right on your face
'til you couldn't breathe!

1068
01:17:51,977 --> 01:17:53,907
- You'd do that?
- Yeah.

1069
01:17:53,977 --> 01:17:55,947
- Promise?
- Yeah.

1070
01:17:59,447 --> 01:18:01,387
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1071
01:18:03,617 --> 01:18:06,057
Oh.

1072
01:18:09,497 --> 01:18:11,427
Did you get everything?

1073
01:18:11,497 --> 01:18:14,487
- Yes, I did.
- Good job, Sugar Pop.

1074
01:18:14,567 --> 01:18:16,497
Did everything
go as planned?

1075
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:19,297
You didn't listen to the ― Ow!

1076
01:18:19,367 --> 01:18:21,307
You didn't listen to the radio?

1077
01:18:21,377 --> 01:18:24,667
I never listen to your fights.
Were you the winner?

1078
01:18:24,747 --> 01:18:27,037
I won, all right.

1079
01:18:27,107 --> 01:18:30,077
- Are you still retiring?
- Sure am.

1080
01:18:30,147 --> 01:18:32,517
So it all worked out
in the finish.

1081
01:18:33,947 --> 01:18:37,387
We're not at the finish yet, baby.

1082
01:18:45,327 --> 01:18:48,197
We're in a lot of danger,
aren't we?

1083
01:18:49,767 --> 01:18:52,707
If they find us,
they'll kill us, won't they?

1084
01:18:54,777 --> 01:18:57,707
But they won't find us,
will they?

1085
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:03,547
Do you still want me
to go with you?

1086
01:19:05,117 --> 01:19:08,777
I don't want to be a burden
or a nuisance. It's ―

1087
01:19:15,397 --> 01:19:17,757
Say it.

1088
01:19:17,827 --> 01:19:20,427
Fabienne,

1089
01:19:20,497 --> 01:19:23,627
I want you to be with me.

1090
01:19:23,697 --> 01:19:26,697
- Forever?
- Forever and ever.

1091
01:19:28,837 --> 01:19:30,807
Do you love me?

1092
01:19:30,877 --> 01:19:32,867
Very, very much.

1093
01:19:38,587 --> 01:19:41,147
- Butch.
- Yes?

1094
01:19:42,587 --> 01:19:45,177
Will you give me
oral pleasure?

1095
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:48,627
Will you kiss it?

1096
01:19:50,557 --> 01:19:52,757
But you first.

1097
01:19:52,827 --> 01:19:55,667
- Okay.
- Okay.

1098
01:20:05,877 --> 01:20:08,177
Butch.

1099
01:20:08,247 --> 01:20:11,667
Mon amour.
L'aventure commence.

1100
01:20:27,327 --> 01:20:29,767
I think I cracked a rib.

1101
01:20:29,837 --> 01:20:33,267
- Giving me oral pleasure?
- No, retard, from the fight.

1102
01:20:33,347 --> 01:20:36,767
- Don't call me "retard."
- My name is Fabby.

1103
01:20:36,837 --> 01:20:39,327
- My name is Fabienne!
- Stop it.

1104
01:20:39,407 --> 01:20:41,337
- Stop it!
- My name is Fabi ―

1105
01:20:41,407 --> 01:20:44,347
Shut up, fuckhead!
I hate that mongoloid voice.

1106
01:20:44,417 --> 01:20:47,507
Okay, okay.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1107
01:20:47,587 --> 01:20:50,517
I take it back.

1108
01:20:52,517 --> 01:20:55,457
Will you hand me a dry towel,
Miss Beautiful Tulip?

1109
01:20:55,527 --> 01:20:59,457
- Oh, I like that.
I like being called a tulip.

1110
01:20:59,527 --> 01:21:01,957
"Tulip" is much better
than "mongoloid."

1111
01:21:02,027 --> 01:21:04,967
I didn't call you a mongoloid.
I called you a retard.

1112
01:21:05,037 --> 01:21:07,157
And I took it back.

1113
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:09,327
Butch?

1114
01:21:09,407 --> 01:21:11,337
Yes, Lemon Pie?

1115
01:21:11,407 --> 01:21:14,837
- Where are we going to go?
- Well, I'm not sure yet.

1116
01:21:14,907 --> 01:21:17,037
Wherever you want.

1117
01:21:17,107 --> 01:21:20,047
We're gonna get a lot
of money from this,

1118
01:21:20,117 --> 01:21:23,047
but it ain't gonna be
the kind of money ...

1119
01:21:23,117 --> 01:21:26,057
that we can live like hogs
in the fathouse forever.

1120
01:21:26,117 --> 01:21:30,057
I was thinking maybe we could go
down someplace in the South Pacific.

1121
01:21:30,127 --> 01:21:33,557
Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna
carry us a long way down there.

1122
01:21:33,627 --> 01:21:36,567
- If we wanted,
we could live in Bora Bora?
- You betcha.

1123
01:21:36,627 --> 01:21:40,067
And if after a while you didn't
dig that, we could go someplace else.

1124
01:21:40,137 --> 01:21:42,067
Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.

1125
01:21:42,137 --> 01:21:44,067
But I do not speak Spanish.

1126
01:21:44,137 --> 01:21:47,107
Well, you do not speak
Bora-Boran either.

1127
01:21:47,177 --> 01:21:49,147
Besides, Mexican's easy.

1128
01:21:49,207 --> 01:21:52,147
- ¿Donde esta el zapateria?
- What does that mean?

1129
01:21:52,217 --> 01:21:54,147
Where is the shoe store?

1130
01:21:54,217 --> 01:21:56,147
- ¿Donde esta ―
- Spit, please.

1131
01:21:58,217 --> 01:22:01,487
- ¿Donde esta el zapateria?
- Excellent pronunciation.

1132
01:22:01,557 --> 01:22:03,577
Mmm.

1133
01:22:03,657 --> 01:22:06,957
You'll be my little mamacita
in no time.

1134
01:22:07,027 --> 01:22:09,557
- ¿Que hora es?
- ¿Que hora es?

1135
01:22:09,627 --> 01:22:11,787
- What time is it?
- What time is it?

1136
01:22:11,867 --> 01:22:14,497
Time for bed.

1137
01:22:14,567 --> 01:22:16,507
Sweet dreams, jellybean.

1138
01:22:24,217 --> 01:22:26,147
Butch?

1139
01:22:32,057 --> 01:22:33,987
Never mind.

1140
01:22:40,967 --> 01:22:43,587
Aah!

1141
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:47,727
Merde! You startled me.
Did you have a bad dream?

1142
01:22:58,177 --> 01:23:02,437
- What is this you're watching?
- A motorcycle movie.

1143
01:23:02,517 --> 01:23:04,447
I'm not sure the name.

1144
01:23:06,357 --> 01:23:09,437
- Are you watching it?
- In a way.

1145
01:23:11,257 --> 01:23:15,347
It's a little early in the morning
for explosions and war.

1146
01:23:18,197 --> 01:23:22,627
- What was it about?
- How should I know?
You were the one watching it.

1147
01:23:22,707 --> 01:23:26,687
- No, imbecile,
what was your dream about?
- I don't know.

1148
01:23:26,777 --> 01:23:28,697
I don't remember.

1149
01:23:28,777 --> 01:23:31,697
It's really rare
that I remember my dreams.

1150
01:23:31,777 --> 01:23:34,737
Well, let's look
at the grumpy man in the morning.

1151
01:23:36,807 --> 01:23:39,747
Why don't you get up
and we'll get some breakfast.

1152
01:23:39,807 --> 01:23:42,437
One more kiss,
and I'll get up.

1153
01:23:44,587 --> 01:23:47,817
- Satisfied?
- Yep.

1154
01:23:47,887 --> 01:23:51,317
- Get up, lazy bones!
- Ohh!

1155
01:23:51,387 --> 01:23:54,447
Ohh. God.

1156
01:23:55,757 --> 01:23:59,287
- What time is it?
- Almost nine in the morning.

1157
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:03,127
- What time does our train arrive?
- Eleven.

1158
01:24:03,197 --> 01:24:07,567
- You know what I'm gonna
have for breakfast?
- What, Lemon Pie?

1159
01:24:07,637 --> 01:24:11,767
I'm gonna order a big plate
of blueberry pancakes ...

1160
01:24:11,847 --> 01:24:13,777
with maple syrup,

1161
01:24:13,847 --> 01:24:17,277
eggs over easy
and five sausages.

1162
01:24:17,347 --> 01:24:19,547
Anything to drink with that?

1163
01:24:19,617 --> 01:24:23,277
Wow, that looks nice.

1164
01:24:23,357 --> 01:24:26,687
To drink ― A tall glass
of orange juice ...

1165
01:24:26,757 --> 01:24:29,187
and a black cup of coffee.

1166
01:24:29,257 --> 01:24:33,827
- After that, I'm going to
have a slice of pie.
- Pie for breakfast?

1167
01:24:33,897 --> 01:24:37,837
- Any time of the day
is a good time for pie.

1168
01:24:37,907 --> 01:24:40,837
Blueberry pie
to go with the pancakes.

1169
01:24:40,907 --> 01:24:43,897
And on top, a thin slice
of melted cheese.

1170
01:24:43,977 --> 01:24:45,907
Where's my watch?

1171
01:24:50,377 --> 01:24:52,647
It's there.

1172
01:24:52,717 --> 01:24:55,307
- No, it's not.
- Have you looked?

1173
01:24:55,387 --> 01:24:59,657
Yes, I've fuckin' looked.
What the fuck do you think I'm doin'?

1174
01:24:59,727 --> 01:25:01,847
You sure you got it?

1175
01:25:01,927 --> 01:25:04,227
Yes.
Bedside table drawer.

1176
01:25:04,297 --> 01:25:07,457
- On the little kangaroo?
- Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.

1177
01:25:07,527 --> 01:25:10,697
Yeah, well,
it's not here now.

1178
01:25:10,767 --> 01:25:13,637
Well, it should be.

1179
01:25:13,707 --> 01:25:17,507
Yes, it most definitely should be,
but it's not here now!
So where the fuck is it?

1180
01:25:23,077 --> 01:25:26,517
Fabienne,
where's my father's fucking watch?

1181
01:25:28,187 --> 01:25:32,627
Do you have any idea what he had
to go through to get me that watch?

1182
01:25:32,687 --> 01:25:35,627
I don't have time to go into it,
but he went through a lot.

1183
01:25:35,697 --> 01:25:41,027
All this other shit you could've set
on fire, but I specifically reminded
you not to forget the fucking watch.

1184
01:25:41,097 --> 01:25:42,427
Now think.

1185
01:25:42,497 --> 01:25:46,027
- Did you get it?
- I believe so.

1186
01:25:46,107 --> 01:25:49,357
"You believe so"?
What the fuck does that mean?
You either did or didn't get it.

1187
01:25:50,777 --> 01:25:52,707
Then I did.

1188
01:25:54,077 --> 01:25:56,017
Are you sure?

1189
01:25:57,117 --> 01:25:59,047
No.

1190
01:26:01,157 --> 01:26:03,077
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1191
01:26:03,157 --> 01:26:05,517
Motherfucker!
Motherfuckin' ―

1192
01:26:07,427 --> 01:26:10,227
Do you know how fucking stupid
you fucking are?

1193
01:26:10,297 --> 01:26:12,217
No!

1194
01:26:14,867 --> 01:26:16,787
It's not your fault.

1195
01:26:21,607 --> 01:26:24,027
You left it at the apartment.

1196
01:26:29,617 --> 01:26:33,037
If you left it at the apartment,
it's not your fault.

1197
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:38,237
I had you bring
a bunch of stuff.

1198
01:26:40,447 --> 01:26:42,387
I reminded you about it,

1199
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:47,217
but I didn't illustrate
how personal the watch was to me.

1200
01:26:47,287 --> 01:26:51,317
If all I gave a fuck about was
the watch, I shoulda told you that.

1201
01:26:51,397 --> 01:26:53,827
You're not a mind reader.

1202
01:26:53,897 --> 01:26:55,827
Are you?

1203
01:27:05,977 --> 01:27:07,907
I ― I'm sorry.

1204
01:27:07,977 --> 01:27:11,567
Don't be. Just means
I can't have breakfast with you.

1205
01:27:11,647 --> 01:27:14,337
Why does it mean that?

1206
01:27:16,917 --> 01:27:20,247
Because I gotta go back to my apartment
and get my watch.

1207
01:27:21,457 --> 01:27:23,977
Won't the gangsters
be looking for you there?

1208
01:27:24,057 --> 01:27:28,327
Well, that's what
I'm gonna find out.

1209
01:27:28,397 --> 01:27:31,627
If they are, and I don't think
I can handle it,

1210
01:27:31,697 --> 01:27:33,637
then I'll split.

1211
01:27:33,697 --> 01:27:37,997
I saw your watch. I thought
I brought it. I'm so sorry.

1212
01:27:43,277 --> 01:27:46,337
Here's some money.
Go out and get those pancakes.

1213
01:27:46,417 --> 01:27:48,277
Have a nice breakfast.

1214
01:27:48,347 --> 01:27:51,787
I'll take your Honda. I'll be back
before you can say "blueberry pie."

1215
01:27:51,857 --> 01:27:54,287
Blueberry pie.

1216
01:27:54,357 --> 01:27:56,517
Maybe not that fast.

1217
01:27:56,587 --> 01:27:59,787
- But pretty fast. Okay?
- Okay.

1218
01:27:59,857 --> 01:28:02,197
- Bye.
- Bye.

1219
01:28:02,267 --> 01:28:05,197
Shit! Of all the fuckin' things
she could fuckin' forget,

1220
01:28:05,267 --> 01:28:07,197
she forgets my father's watch!

1221
01:28:07,267 --> 01:28:09,207
I specifically reminded her ―

1222
01:28:09,267 --> 01:28:11,397
bedside table, on the kangaroo.

1223
01:28:11,477 --> 01:28:14,737
I said the words:
"Don't forget my father's watch."

1224

wake him up now, won't you?

1337
01:46:01,587 --> 01:46:05,687
I want you to pick it up, Zed.

1338
01:46:09,927 --> 01:46:12,987
Step aside, Butch.

1339
01:46:25,247 --> 01:46:28,277
Fuck!

1340
01:46:30,887 --> 01:46:33,817
You okay?

1341
01:46:35,187 --> 01:46:37,347
No, man.

1342
01:46:37,427 --> 01:46:40,357
I'm pretty fuckin' far from okay.

1343
01:46:51,537 --> 01:46:54,477
What now?

1344
01:46:56,807 --> 01:46:58,747
"What now"?

1345
01:47:00,117 --> 01:47:03,537
Let me tell you what now.

1346
01:47:03,617 --> 01:47:06,547
I'm gonna call a couple of hard,
pipe-hittin' niggers ...

1347
01:47:06,617 --> 01:47:09,547
to go to work
on the homes here ...

1348
01:47:09,627 --> 01:47:12,547
with a pair of pliers
and a blowtorch.

1349
01:47:14,527 --> 01:47:17,217
You hear me talkin',
hillbilly boy?

1350
01:47:18,497 --> 01:47:21,047
I ain't through with you
by a damn sight!

1351
01:47:21,127 --> 01:47:24,057
I'm gonna get medieval
on your ass.

1352
01:47:27,337 --> 01:47:30,267
I meant what now
between me and you.

1353
01:47:35,337 --> 01:47:37,737
Oh, that "what now."

1354
01:47:39,177 --> 01:47:43,117
I tell you what now
between me and you.

1355
01:47:44,687 --> 01:47:47,617
There is no me and you.

1356
01:47:49,057 --> 01:47:50,987
Not no more.

1357
01:47:54,057 --> 01:47:55,997
So, are we cool?

1358
01:47:57,367 --> 01:47:59,657
Yeah, we cool.

1359
01:47:59,727 --> 01:48:01,857
Two things.

1360
01:48:03,637 --> 01:48:06,567
Don't tell nobody about this.

1361
01:48:08,037 --> 01:48:11,667
This shit is between me, you ...

1362
01:48:11,747 --> 01:48:16,207
and Mr. "Soon-To-Be-Livin'
The-Rest-Of-His-Short-Ass-
Life-ln-Agonizing-Pain" ...

1363
01:48:16,277 --> 01:48:18,217
rapist here.

1364
01:48:19,517 --> 01:48:22,277
It ain't nobody else's business.

1365
01:48:22,357 --> 01:48:24,287
Two:

1366
01:48:24,357 --> 01:48:27,847
You leave town tonight.
Right now.

1367
01:48:29,097 --> 01:48:31,027
And when you gone,

1368
01:48:31,097 --> 01:48:33,027
you stay gone,

1369
01:48:33,097 --> 01:48:36,037
or you be gone.

1370
01:48:36,097 --> 01:48:39,037
You lost all your L.A. privileges.
Deal?

1371
01:48:40,877 --> 01:48:42,807
Deal.

1372
01:48:44,047 --> 01:48:45,977
Get your ass outta here.

1373
01:49:12,437 --> 01:49:14,687
Oh, shit.

1374
01:49:47,687 --> 01:49:50,117
Fabienne!

1375
01:49:51,187 --> 01:49:54,127
Fabienne!

1376
01:49:55,357 --> 01:49:57,457
Fabienne!
Come on, baby.

1377
01:49:57,527 --> 01:50:00,957
- Come on. Get your shit.
We gotta go right now.
- I was so worried.

1378
01:50:01,037 --> 01:50:04,457
- What about our bags?
- Fuck the bags; if we don't split
right now, we'll miss the train.

1379
01:50:04,537 --> 01:50:06,457
- I'll be downstairs.
- Is everything well?

1380
01:50:06,527 --> 01:50:10,467
- Just come on! No talking now!
- Are we in danger?

1381
01:50:13,977 --> 01:50:15,907
Come on, honey!

1382
01:50:17,987 --> 01:50:20,447
Where did you get
this motorcycle?

1383
01:50:20,507 --> 01:50:25,037
- It's not a motorcycle, baby.
It's a chopper. Let's go.
- What happened to my Honda?

1384
01:50:25,117 --> 01:50:28,877
I'm sorry, baby,
I had to crash that Honda.
Will you come on now, please?

1385
01:50:28,947 --> 01:50:31,347
Come on. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

1386
01:50:35,927 --> 01:50:39,357
- You're hurt?
- No, no, I might've broken
my nose. It's no biggie.

1387
01:50:39,427 --> 01:50:42,367
Come on. Hop on.
Baby, please, we ―

1388
01:50:42,437 --> 01:50:45,367
Honey, we gotta hit
the fuckin' road! Get on!

1389
01:50:47,037 --> 01:50:50,477
- Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
Come here, come here.

1390
01:50:50,537 --> 01:50:52,477
I'm sorry. Mmm.

1391
01:50:52,547 --> 01:50:56,477
- I'm so sorry.
- You were gone so long, I started
to think dreadful thoughts.

1392
01:50:56,547 --> 01:50:59,477
I didn't mean to worry you.
Everything's fine.

1393
01:50:59,547 --> 01:51:01,487
- How was your breakfast?
- It was good.

1394
01:51:01,547 --> 01:51:03,487
Did you get
the blueberry pancakes?

1395
01:51:03,557 --> 01:51:07,487
They didn't have blueberry; I had to get
buttermilk. Are you sure you're okay?

1396
01:51:07,557 --> 01:51:10,497
Since I left you,
this has been, without a doubt,

1397
01:51:10,557 --> 01:51:13,787
the single weirdest
fuckin' day of my life ―
I'll tell you all about it.

1398
01:51:13,867 --> 01:51:15,727
Gotta go. Come on.

1399
01:51:15,797 --> 01:51:18,567
Butch, whose motorcycle
is this?

1400
01:51:18,637 --> 01:51:21,227
- It's a chopper, baby.
- Whose chopper is this?

1401
01:51:21,307 --> 01:51:23,237
- Zed's.
- Who's Zed?

1402
01:51:23,307 --> 01:51:25,867
Zed's dead, baby.
Zed's dead.

1403
01:51:42,057 --> 01:51:44,357
Yes, you did, Brett!

1404
01:51:44,427 --> 01:51:47,957
You tried to fuck him,
and Marsellus Wallace
don't liked to be fucked ...

1405
01:51:48,027 --> 01:51:50,467
by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

1406
01:51:50,537 --> 01:51:53,627
- Oh, God, please. I don't wanna die.
- You read the Bible, Brett?

1407
01:51:53,707 --> 01:51:57,137
- Yes!
- Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

1408
01:51:57,207 --> 01:51:59,367
Sorta fits the occasion.

1409
01:51:59,447 --> 01:52:02,737
Ezekiel 25:17.

1410
01:52:02,817 --> 01:52:07,117
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides ...

1411
01:52:07,187 --> 01:52:09,117
by the inequities
of the selfish ...

1412
01:52:09,187 --> 01:52:12,617
and the tyranny of evil men.

1413
01:52:12,687 --> 01:52:17,357
Blessed is he who, in the name
of charity and good will,

1414
01:52:17,427 --> 01:52:20,457
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

1415
01:52:20,527 --> 01:52:23,057
for he is truly
his brother's keeper ...

1416
01:52:23,137 --> 01:52:25,867
and the finder
of lost children.

1417
01:52:25,937 --> 01:52:30,197
And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance ...

1418
01:52:30,277 --> 01:52:32,437
and furious anger ...

1419
01:52:32,507 --> 01:52:36,897
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

1420
01:52:36,977 --> 01:52:40,847
And you will know
My name is the Lord ...

1421
01:52:40,917 --> 01:52:44,307
when I lay My vengeance
upon thee."

1422
01:52:52,397 --> 01:52:54,817
I'm fucked.
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

1423
01:52:54,897 --> 01:52:57,837
- ls he a friend of yours?
- Oh, goddamn. Goddamn.

1424
01:52:57,897 --> 01:53:00,837
Hmm? Oh.
Vincent, Marvin. Marvin, Vincent.

1425
01:53:00,907 --> 01:53:03,827
- Better tell him to shut up.
He's gettin' on my nerves.
- Fuck.

1426
01:53:03,907 --> 01:53:07,097
Marvin. Marvin!
I'd knock that shit off if I was you.

1427
01:53:07,177 --> 01:53:11,327
Die, you motherfuckers! Die!

1428
01:53:39,497 --> 01:53:42,937
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
somebody was in the bathroom?

1429
01:53:43,007 --> 01:53:45,867
Slip your mind? Did you forget
that someone was in there ...

1430
01:53:45,937 --> 01:53:47,877
with a goddamn hand cannon?

1431
01:53:47,937 --> 01:53:51,877
You see the size of that gun he fired
at us? It was bigger than him.

1432
01:53:56,647 --> 01:53:59,347
We should be fuckin' dead, man.

1433
01:53:59,417 --> 01:54:01,357
I know.
We was lucky.

1434
01:54:01,417 --> 01:54:04,547
No, no, no, no.
That shit wasn't luck.

1435
01:54:04,627 --> 01:54:08,827
- Yeah, maybe.
- This was divine intervention.

1436
01:54:08,897 --> 01:54:10,827
You know what
divine intervention is?

1437
01:54:16,707 --> 01:54:18,637
I think so.

1438
01:54:18,707 --> 01:54:22,137
That means that God came down
from Heaven and stopped the bullets.

1439
01:54:22,207 --> 01:54:24,647
That's right.
That's exactly what it means.

1440
01:54:24,707 --> 01:54:27,677
God came down from Heaven
and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.

1441
01:54:28,917 --> 01:54:30,907
I think it's time for us
to leave, Jules.

1442
01:54:30,987 --> 01:54:33,417
Don't do that.
Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!

1443
01:54:33,487 --> 01:54:37,427
- What just happened here
was a fuckin' miracle!
- Chill. This shit happens.

1444
01:54:37,487 --> 01:54:40,257
Wrong! Wrong.
This shit doesn't "just happen."

1445
01:54:40,327 --> 01:54:43,767
Do you want to continue
this theological discussion in a car ...

1446
01:54:43,827 --> 01:54:46,267
or in a jailhouse
with the cops?

1447
01:54:46,337 --> 01:54:48,957
We should be fuckin' dead,
my friend!

1448
01:54:49,037 --> 01:54:53,267
What happened here was a miracle, and I
want you to fucking acknowledge it!

1449
01:54:53,337 --> 01:54:58,037
All right, it was a miracle.
Can we go now?

1450
01:55:05,047 --> 01:55:08,417
Let's go, nigger!
Come on! Shit.

1451
01:55:10,297 --> 01:55:12,097
You ever seen that show Cops?

1452
01:55:12,167 --> 01:55:15,097
I was watching it one time,
and there was this cop on,

1453
01:55:15,167 --> 01:55:19,107
and he was talkin' about this
gunfight he had in the hallway
with this guy, right?

1454
01:55:19,177 --> 01:55:22,627
He just unloaded on this guy and nothin'
happened. He didn't hit nothin'.

1455
01:55:22,707 --> 01:55:25,647
Okay? It was just
him and this guy.

1456
01:55:25,717 --> 01:55:29,047
I mean, you know, it's,
it's freaky, but it happens.

1457
01:55:29,117 --> 01:55:34,057
You wanna play blind man,
go walk with the shepherd,
but me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.

1458
01:55:34,117 --> 01:55:37,057
- What the fuck does that mean?
- It means that's it for me.

1459
01:55:37,127 --> 01:55:39,817
From here on in, you can
consider my ass retired.

1460
01:55:39,897 --> 01:55:42,057
- Jesus Christ. Goddamn it.
- Don't blaspheme.

1461
01:55:42,127 --> 01:55:45,177
- I said, don't do that!
- Hey, why are you fuckin'
freakin' out on us?

1462
01:55:45,267 --> 01:55:48,317
Look, I'm tellin' Marsellus today ―
I'm through.

1463
01:55:48,407 --> 01:55:51,327
- Why don't you tell him
at the same time why?
- Don't worry, I will.

1464
01:55:51,407 --> 01:55:55,387
- And I bet you $10,000
he laughs his ass off.
- I don't give a damn if he does.

1465
01:55:55,477 --> 01:55:58,557
Marvin, what do you make of all this?

1466
01:55:58,647 --> 01:56:01,067
Man, I don't even
have an opinion.

1467
01:56:01,147 --> 01:56:05,367
You gotta have an opinion. You think God 
came down from Heaven and stopped ―

1468
01:56:05,457 --> 01:56:07,437
What the fuck's happenin'?

1469
01:56:07,507 --> 01:56:09,447
- Aw, shit, man!
- Aw, man!

1470
01:56:09,527 --> 01:56:12,447
- Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.
- Why the fuck'd you do that?

1471
01:56:12,487 --> 01:56:13,747
I didn't mean it.
It was an accident.

1472
01:56:13,827 --> 01:56:16,757
- Man, I seen some crazy-ass
shit in my time, but this ―
- Chill out, man!

1473
01:56:16,817 --> 01:56:19,757
It was an accident. We probably
went over a bump or somethin'.

1474
01:56:19,827 --> 01:56:21,757
The car ain't hit
no motherfuckin' bump.

1475
01:56:21,827 --> 01:56:25,157
I didn't mean to shoot
the son of a bitch. The gun went off.

1476
01:56:25,227 --> 01:56:28,667
Look at this fuckin' mess! We're on
a city street in broad daylight here!

1477
01:56:28,737 --> 01:56:31,667
- I don't believe it!
- Well, believe it now, motherfucker!

1478
01:56:31,737 --> 01:56:34,727
We gotta get this car off
the road. Cops notice shit
like a car drenched in blood.

1479
01:56:34,757 --> 01:56:37,707
- Just take it to
a friendly place, that's all!
- This is the Valley, Vincent.

1480
01:56:37,777 --> 01:56:40,207
Marsellus ain't got
no friendly places in the Valley.

1481
01:56:40,277 --> 01:56:43,217
- Well, Jules, this ain't
my fuckin' town, man!
- Shit!

1482
01:56:43,287 --> 01:56:46,217
- What you doing?
- I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.

1483
01:56:46,287 --> 01:56:49,817
- Where's Toluca Lake?
- Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.

1484
01:56:49,887 --> 01:56:52,827
If Jimmie's ass ain't home,
I don't know what the fuck we gonna do,

1485
01:56:52,887 --> 01:56:55,827
'cause I ain't got
no other partners in 818.

1486
01:56:55,897 --> 01:56:58,827
Jimmie, how you doin', man?
It's Jules. Just listen up, man.

1487
01:56:58,897 --> 01:57:02,837
Me and my homeboy are in a car, and we
gotta get it off the road, pronto.

1488
01:57:02,897 --> 01:57:05,097
I need to use your garage
for a couple hours.

1489
01:57:07,107 --> 01:57:10,037
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie situation.

1490
01:57:10,107 --> 01:57:13,737
He's one remark away
from kickin' our asses out the door.

1491
01:57:13,817 --> 01:57:16,747
- If he does, what do we do?
- We ain't leavin'
'til we make a couple calls,

1492
01:57:16,817 --> 01:57:19,747
but I don't want it to reach
that pitch ― Jimmie's a friend.

1493
01:57:19,817 --> 01:57:22,757
You don't come into your friend's house
and start tellin' him what's what.

1494
01:57:22,817 --> 01:57:24,757
Just tell him
not to be abusive.

1495
01:57:24,827 --> 01:57:26,757
He kinda freaked out back there
when he saw Marvin.

1496
01:57:26,827 --> 01:57:29,987
Put yourself in his position-
It's 8:00 in the morning,
he just woke up.

1497
01:57:30,057 --> 01:57:31,997
He wasn't expectin' this shit.

1498
01:57:32,067 --> 01:57:34,997
We gotta remember here
who's doin' who a favor.

1499
01:57:35,067 --> 01:57:39,007
If that favor means I gotta
take shit, he can stick that
favor straight up his ass.

1500
01:57:39,367 --> 01:57:43,307
- Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd
you just do to his towel, man?
- I was dryin' my hands!

1501
01:57:43,377 --> 01:57:46,307
- You're supposed to wash 'em first!
- You watched me wash 'em.

1502
01:57:46,377 --> 01:57:49,937
- I watched you get 'em wet.
- I was washin' 'em.
This shit's hard to get off.

1503
01:57:50,017 --> 01:57:51,947
Maybe if he'd had Lava
I coulda done a better job.

1504
01:57:52,017 --> 01:57:53,947
I used the same
fuckin' soap you did,

1505
01:57:54,017 --> 01:57:56,957
and when I finished, the towel
didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad!

1506
01:57:57,017 --> 01:57:59,957
What if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this?

1507
01:58:00,027 --> 01:58:04,117
It's shit like this that's gonna bring
this situation to a head, man!

1508
01:58:04,197 --> 01:58:07,627
Look, I ain't threatenin' you
or nothin', all right?

1509
01:58:07,697 --> 01:58:12,157
You know I respect you and all.
But just don't put me
in this position, all right?

1510
01:58:12,237 --> 01:58:14,937
All right.
Fine. Fine.

1511
01:58:15,007 --> 01:58:17,937
Ask me nice like that,
no problem.

1512
01:58:18,007 --> 01:58:20,947
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.

1513
01:58:22,677 --> 01:58:25,547
Mmm! Goddamn, Jimmie!

1514
01:58:25,617 --> 01:58:27,707
This some serious
gourmet shit.

1515
01:58:27,787 --> 01:58:29,717
Me and Vincent
would've been satisfied ...

1516
01:58:29,787 --> 01:58:31,757
with some freeze-dried
Taster's Choice.

1517
01:58:31,827 --> 01:58:33,757
Right?

1518
01:58:33,827 --> 01:58:36,757
And he springs this
serious gourmet shit on us.

1519
01:58:36,827 --> 01:58:38,887
- What flavor is this?
- Knock it off, Julie.

1520
01:58:38,967 --> 01:58:42,977
- What?
- I don't need you to tell me
how fuckin' good my coffee is.

1521
01:58:43,067 --> 01:58:45,557
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.

1522
01:58:45,637 --> 01:58:47,567
When Bonnie goes shopping,
she buys shit.

1523
01:58:47,637 --> 01:58:51,257
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause
when I drink it, I wanna taste it.

1524
01:58:51,347 --> 01:58:55,267
But you know what's on
my mind right now? It ain't
the coffee in my kitchen.

1525
01:58:55,347 --> 01:58:57,507
It's the dead nigger
in my garage.

1526
01:58:57,587 --> 01:59:01,007
- Jimmie, don't even worry-
- Don't tell me about anything.
I wanna ask you a question.

1527
01:59:01,087 --> 01:59:03,007
When you came pulling in here,

1528
01:59:03,087 --> 01:59:06,277
did you notice the sign
on the front of my house that said,
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

1529
01:59:06,347 --> 01:59:09,787
- You know I ain't seen no-
- Did you notice the sign on
the front of my house ...

1530
01:59:09,857 --> 01:59:11,787
that said,
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

1531
01:59:11,867 --> 01:59:14,587
No. I didn't.

1532
01:59:14,657 --> 01:59:17,587
- You know why you didn't
see that sign?
- Why?

1533
01:59:17,657 --> 01:59:22,187
'Cause it ain't there,
'cause storing dead niggers
ain't my fuckin' business, that's why!

1534
01:59:22,267 --> 01:59:25,197
- We're not gonna store
the motherfucker ―
- Don't you fuckin' realize ...

1535
01:59:25,267 --> 01:59:29,707
that if Bonnie comes home and
finds a dead body in her house,
I'm gonna get divorced?

1536
01:59:29,767 --> 01:59:33,007
No marriage counselor.
No trial separation.
I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.

1537
01:59:33,077 --> 01:59:36,437
Okay? And I don't wanna
get fuckin' divorced!

1538
01:59:36,507 --> 01:59:41,507
Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you,
but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.

1539
01:59:41,587 --> 01:59:43,677
Jimmie, Jimmie,
she ain't gonna leave you.

1540
01:59:43,747 --> 01:59:47,687
Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me, Jules!
Okay? Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me.

1541
01:59:47,757 --> 01:59:51,717
There's nothin' you're gonna
say that's gonna make me forget
I love my wife. Is there?

1542
01:59:54,867 --> 01:59:59,527
Now, look, you know, she comes home
from work in about an hour and a half.

1543
01:59:59,597 --> 02:00:02,657
The graveyard shift
at the hospital.

1544
02:00:02,737 --> 02:00:05,797
You gotta make some phone calls?
You gotta call some people?

1545
02:00:05,877 --> 02:00:09,807
Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck
out of my house before she gets here.

1546
02:00:09,877 --> 02:00:12,817
That's Kool and the Gang.
We don't wanna fuck your shit up.

1547
02:00:12,877 --> 02:00:15,847
All I wanna do is call my people
and get 'em to bring us in.

1548
02:00:15,917 --> 02:00:18,857
You're fucking my shit up
right now!

1549
02:00:18,917 --> 02:00:22,017
You're gonna fuck my shit up
big time if Bonnie comes home.

1550
02:00:22,087 --> 02:00:25,587
Do me that favor, all right?
The phone is in my bedroom.
I suggest you get going.

1551
02:00:25,657 --> 02:00:28,597
Well, say she comes home.

1552
02:00:28,667 --> 02:00:31,097
What do you think she'll do?

1553
02:00:32,597 --> 02:00:35,037
Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.

1554
02:00:35,107 --> 02:00:37,297
That ain't no kinda answer.

1555
02:00:37,367 --> 02:00:40,427
I mean, you know, I don't.
How much? A lot or a little?

1556
02:00:40,507 --> 02:00:43,377
You got to appreciate
what an explosive element ...

1557
02:00:43,447 --> 02:00:45,377
this Bonnie situation is.

1558
02:00:45,447 --> 02:00:49,387
She comes home from a hard day's work,
finds a bunch of gangsters
in her kitchen ...

1559
02:00:49,447 --> 02:00:51,387
doing a bunch of gangster shit,

1560
02:00:51,457 --> 02:00:54,517
there ain't no tellin'
what she's liable to do.

1561
02:00:56,687 --> 02:00:58,627
Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.

1562
02:00:58,697 --> 02:01:01,287
All I'm doing is
contemplating the ifs.

1563
02:01:01,367 --> 02:01:04,297
I don't wanna hear about
no motherfuckin' ifs!

1564
02:01:04,367 --> 02:01:08,297
All I want to hear from your ass
is, "You ain't got no problem,
Jules. I'm on the motherfucker.

1565
02:01:08,367 --> 02:01:12,537
Chill them niggers out
and wait for the cavalry,
which should be coming directly."

1566
02:01:12,607 --> 02:01:15,767
You ain't got no problem, Jules.

1567
02:01:15,847 --> 02:01:17,967
I'm on the motherfucker.

1568
02:01:18,047 --> 02:01:23,107
Chill them niggers out and wait for
the Wolf, who should be coming directly.

1569
02:01:23,187 --> 02:01:25,617
You sendin' the Wolf?

1570
02:01:25,687 --> 02:01:27,877
Oh, you feel better,
motherfucker?

1571
02:01:27,957 --> 02:01:30,217
Shit, yeah, negro!

1572
02:01:30,287 --> 02:01:33,417
That's all you had to say!

1573
02:01:33,497 --> 02:01:36,677
She the hysterical type?

1574
02:01:36,767 --> 02:01:39,697
When is she due?

1575
02:01:39,767 --> 02:01:41,857
Mm-hmm.

1576
02:01:41,937 --> 02:01:43,857
Give me
the principals' names again.

1577
02:01:43,937 --> 02:01:45,877
Place your bets.

1578
02:01:46,937 --> 02:01:50,597
- Jules. Mm-hmm.
- Cards, please.

1579
02:01:50,677 --> 02:01:52,617
Vincent.

1580
02:01:57,347 --> 02:01:59,277
Jimmie.

1581
02:02:00,507 --> 02:02:02,637
Bonnie. Mm-hmm.

1582
02:02:08,067 --> 02:02:11,147
It's thirty minutes away.
I'll be there in ten.

1583
02:02:27,967 --> 02:02:30,897
You're ... Jimmie, right?
This is your house?

1584
02:02:30,967 --> 02:02:34,597
- It sure is.
- I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.

1585
02:02:34,677 --> 02:02:37,607
- Good. We got one.
- So I heard. May I come in?

1586
02:02:37,677 --> 02:02:39,607
Uh, yeah. Please do.

1587
02:02:39,677 --> 02:02:43,337
You must be Jules.
Which would make you ... Vincent.

1588
02:02:43,417 --> 02:02:45,847
Let's get down
to brass tacks, gentlemen.

1589
02:02:45,917 --> 02:02:48,857
If I was informed correctly, the clock
is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie?

1590
02:02:48,917 --> 02:02:50,857
Uh, one hundred percent.

1591
02:02:50,927 --> 02:02:54,857
- Your wife Bonnie comes home
at 9:30 in the a.m., correct?
- Uh-huh.

1592
02:02:54,927 --> 02:02:59,417
I was led to believe if she
comes home and finds us here,
she wouldn't appreciate it much.

1593
02:02:59,497 --> 02:03:03,797
- She wouldn't at that.
- That gives us 40 minutes
to get the fuck outta Dodge,

1594
02:03:03,867 --> 02:03:07,307
which, if you do what I say,
when I say it, should be plenty.

1595
02:03:07,377 --> 02:03:11,707
Now, you got a corpse
in a car, minus a head,
in a garage. Take me to it.

1596
02:03:19,447 --> 02:03:21,387
- Jimmie.
- Uh-huh.

1597
02:03:21,457 --> 02:03:24,887
Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I
smelled some coffee back there.

1598
02:03:24,957 --> 02:03:28,397
- Would you make me a cup?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

1599
02:03:29,857 --> 02:03:32,797
Oh, uh, um,
how do you take it?

1600
02:03:32,867 --> 02:03:35,427
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

1601
02:03:37,507 --> 02:03:40,937
About the car, is there anything
I need to know? Does it stall?

1602
02:03:41,007 --> 02:03:44,447
Does it smoke? Does it make
a lot of noise? ls there gas in it?

1603
02:03:44,507 --> 02:03:47,947
- Aside from how it looks,
the car's cool.
- Positive?

1604
02:03:48,017 --> 02:03:51,447
Don't get me on the road and I find out
the brake lights don't work.

1605
02:03:51,517 --> 02:03:55,577
- As far as I know,
the motherfucker's tip-top.
- Good enough.

1606
02:03:55,657 --> 02:03:57,677
Let's go back
to the kitchen.

1607
02:04:03,327 --> 02:04:06,267
- Here you go, Mr. Wolf.
- Thank you, Jimmie.

1608
02:04:11,107 --> 02:04:13,037
Mmm.

1609
02:04:14,107 --> 02:04:16,237
Okay, first thing.
You two.

1610
02:04:16,307 --> 02:04:19,247
Take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

1611
02:04:19,307 --> 02:04:22,037
This looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

1612
02:04:22,117 --> 02:04:26,047
- That would lead me to believe
you got cleansers and shit.
- Yeah. Under the sink.

1613
02:04:26,117 --> 02:04:29,547
Good. What I need you two fellas to do
is take those cleaning products ...

1614
02:04:29,617 --> 02:04:33,647
and clean the inside of the car ―
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

1615
02:04:33,727 --> 02:04:37,657
Go in the back seat, scoop up all
those little pieces of brain and skull.

1616
02:04:37,727 --> 02:04:40,667
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

1617
02:04:40,737 --> 02:04:43,657
It don't need to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.

1618
02:04:43,737 --> 02:04:48,097
Just give it a good once-over.
What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts.

1619
02:04:48,177 --> 02:04:52,257
The pools of blood that have collected,
you gotta soak that shit up.

1620
02:04:52,347 --> 02:04:54,767
We need to raid
your linen closet.

1621
02:04:54,847 --> 02:04:57,767
I need blankets,
I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.

1622
02:04:57,847 --> 02:05:01,467
The thicker the better,
the darker the better.
No whites. Can't use 'em.

1623
02:05:01,547 --> 02:05:06,847
We'll need to camouflage the front seat
and back seat and floorboards ...

1624
02:05:06,927 --> 02:05:08,847
with quilts and blankets,

1625
02:05:08,927 --> 02:05:12,857
so if a cop starts stickin'
his big snout in the car,
the subterfuge won't last,

1626
02:05:12,917 --> 02:05:15,787
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.

1627
02:05:15,857 --> 02:05:17,917
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.

1628
02:05:17,997 --> 02:05:19,757
"Please" would be nice.

1629
02:05:21,227 --> 02:05:24,167
- Come again?
- I said, a "please" would be nice.

1630
02:05:26,067 --> 02:05:29,897
Get it straight, buster.
I'm not here to say please.
I'm here to tell you what to do.

1631
02:05:31,707 --> 02:05:34,637
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess,

1632
02:05:34,707 --> 02:05:37,147
you'd better fuckin' do it
and do it quick.

1633
02:05:37,217 --> 02:05:41,117
I'm here to help. If my help's
not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.

1634
02:05:41,187 --> 02:05:44,517
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;
your help is definitely appreciated.

1635
02:05:44,587 --> 02:05:47,517
Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't
mean disrespect, okay? I respect you.

1636
02:05:47,587 --> 02:05:50,387
I just don't like people
barkin' orders at me.

1637
02:05:50,457 --> 02:05:53,517
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

1638
02:05:53,597 --> 02:05:58,227
I think fast, I talk fast,
and I need you guys to act fast
if you wanna get out of this.

1639
02:05:58,297 --> 02:06:01,737
So pretty please, with sugar on top,
clean the fuckin' car.

1640
02:06:06,237 --> 02:06:09,907
Don't be lookin' at me like that,
all right? I can feel your look.

1641
02:06:12,617 --> 02:06:15,307
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

1642
02:06:17,387 --> 02:06:19,317
Green.

1643
02:06:20,927 --> 02:06:23,857
Nothin' except for
the mess inside.

1644
02:06:26,057 --> 02:06:28,497
Mmm, about 20 minutes.

1645
02:06:29,997 --> 02:06:31,937
Nobody who'll be missed.

1646
02:06:34,007 --> 02:06:36,937
You're a good man, Joe.
Thanks a bunch.

1647
02:06:38,037 --> 02:06:39,977
- How we comin', Jimmie?
- Pretty good.

1648
02:06:40,037 --> 02:06:43,207
I got it all here, but, uh,

1649
02:06:43,277 --> 02:06:46,717
- Mr. Wolf,
you gotta understand something.
- Winston, Jimmie, Winston.

1650
02:06:46,777 --> 02:06:50,307
Okay. You gotta
understand something, uh, Winston.

1651
02:06:50,387 --> 02:06:52,317
Uh- Uh, no,
thank you.

1652
02:06:52,387 --> 02:06:55,517
Uh, this is
our best linen here,

1653
02:06:55,587 --> 02:06:58,527
and it's, uh ―
it was a wedding present ...

1654
02:06:58,597 --> 02:07:01,027
from my Uncle Conrad
and my Aunt Ginny.

1655
02:07:01,097 --> 02:07:05,537
- They're not with us anymore.
I wanna help ―
- Let me ask you a question.

1656
02:07:05,597 --> 02:07:08,537
- If you don't mind.
- No, no, please. Go ahead.

1657
02:07:10,107 --> 02:07:15,007
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny,
were they millionaires?

1658
02:07:16,147 --> 02:07:18,077
No.

1659
02:07:18,147 --> 02:07:20,577
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.

1660
02:07:20,647 --> 02:07:24,107
And I'm positive that if
Uncle Conrad and Aunt ...

1661
02:07:24,187 --> 02:07:26,617
- Ginny.
- Ginny were here,

1662
02:07:26,687 --> 02:07:30,947
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set,

1663
02:07:31,027 --> 02:07:34,147
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

1664
02:07:38,137 --> 02:07:42,057
I like oak myself.
That's what I have in my bedroom.

1665
02:07:43,207 --> 02:07:45,127
How about you, Jimmie?

1666
02:07:46,377 --> 02:07:48,307
You an oak man?

1667
02:07:49,407 --> 02:07:51,347
Oak's nice.

1668
02:07:57,177 --> 02:08:01,047
Oh, man, I will never
forgive your ass for this shit.

1669
02:08:01,117 --> 02:08:03,547
This is some fucked-up,
repugnant shit.

1670
02:08:03,627 --> 02:08:07,047
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits he is wrong ...

1671
02:08:07,127 --> 02:08:10,057
that he is immediately forgiven
for all wrongdoings?

1672
02:08:10,117 --> 02:08:13,057
Get the fuck out my face
with that shit!

1673
02:08:13,127 --> 02:08:15,987
The motherfucker that said
that shit never had to pick up
itty-bitty pieces of skull ...

1674
02:08:16,057 --> 02:08:19,827
- on account of your dumb ass.
- I got a threshold, Jules,
for the abuse that I will take.

1675
02:08:19,897 --> 02:08:23,497
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,
and you got me in the red.

1676
02:08:23,567 --> 02:08:27,007
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous
to have a race car in the fuckin' red.

1677
02:08:27,067 --> 02:08:29,007
That's all.
I could blow.

1678
02:08:29,077 --> 02:08:31,007
- Oh, you ready to blow?
- Yeah.

1679
02:08:31,077 --> 02:08:34,007
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'
motherfucker, motherfucker.

1680
02:08:34,077 --> 02:08:37,017
Every time my fingers touch brain,
I'm Superfly T.N.T.

1681
02:08:37,077 --> 02:08:39,017
I'm the Guns of the Navarone.

1682
02:08:39,087 --> 02:08:42,017
In fact, what the fuck
am I doin' in the back?

1683
02:08:42,087 --> 02:08:45,317
You're the motherfucker should be on
brain detail! We're fuckin' switchin'.

1684
02:08:45,387 --> 02:08:47,827
I'm washin' windows, and you're
pickin' up this nigger's skull!

1685
02:08:57,607 --> 02:08:59,537
Fine job, gentlemen.

1686
02:09:00,877 --> 02:09:03,307
You may get out of this yet.

1687
02:09:03,377 --> 02:09:05,807
I can't believe
this is the same car.

1688
02:09:05,877 --> 02:09:09,317
Well, let's not start suckin'
each other's dicks quite yet.

1689
02:09:09,377 --> 02:09:12,817
Phase one is complete ― Clean the car ―
which moves us right along to Phase two:

1690
02:09:12,887 --> 02:09:14,817
Clean you two.

1691
02:09:16,387 --> 02:09:18,257
Strip.

1692
02:09:18,327 --> 02:09:22,087
- All the way?
- To your bare ass.

1693
02:09:22,157 --> 02:09:25,257
Quickly, gentlemen.
We got about 15 minutes ...

1694
02:09:25,327 --> 02:09:28,267
before Jimmie's better half
comes pulling into the driveway.

1695
02:09:28,337 --> 02:09:30,827
Goddamn, this morning air
is some chilly shit.

1696
02:09:30,907 --> 02:09:32,857
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary?

1697
02:09:32,987 --> 02:09:35,287
- You know what you two look like?
- What?

1698
02:09:35,357 --> 02:09:38,797
Like a couple of guys
who just blew off somebody's head.

1699
02:09:38,857 --> 02:09:42,227
Strippin' off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

1700
02:09:46,537 --> 02:09:49,007
Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.

1701
02:09:49,067 --> 02:09:53,507
Don't do nothin' stupid,
like leavin' this shit out front
for the garbageman to pick up.

1702
02:09:53,577 --> 02:09:57,807
Don't worry, we're taking it with us.
Jim, the soap.

1703
02:09:59,247 --> 02:10:01,187
- Vincent.
- Okay, gentlemen.

1704
02:10:01,247 --> 02:10:04,747
You both been to County before,
I'm sure. Here it comes.

1705
02:10:04,817 --> 02:10:07,757
- Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold!
- Yo! Yo! Yo!

1706
02:10:07,827 --> 02:10:11,057
Better you than me, gentlemen.

1707
02:10:11,127 --> 02:10:14,067
- Don't be afraid of the soap.
Spread it around.

1708
02:10:14,127 --> 02:10:16,997
- Get 'em there a little bit.
Vincent's hair.
- Hey, get out of my hair!

1709
02:10:17,067 --> 02:10:19,967
- Come on. Do it, goddamn it! Do it!
- Uh, um ―

1710
02:10:21,037 --> 02:10:22,967
Towel.

1711
02:10:33,487 --> 02:10:36,637
You're dry enough.
Toss 'em their clothes.

1712
02:10:36,717 --> 02:10:39,977
Perfect.

1713
02:10:40,057 --> 02:10:43,507
Perfect. We couldn't have
planned this better.

1714
02:10:43,597 --> 02:10:45,527
You guys look like ―

1715
02:10:45,597 --> 02:10:48,027
What do they look like,
Jimmie?

1716
02:10:48,097 --> 02:10:51,687
- Dorks. They look like
a couple of dorks.

1717
02:10:51,767 --> 02:10:55,247
- Ha-ha-ha. They're your
clothes, motherfucker.

1718
02:10:55,327 --> 02:10:58,057
Come on, gentlemen.
We're laughing our way
right into prison.

1719
02:10:58,127 --> 02:11:00,067
Don't make me beg.

1720
02:11:03,147 --> 02:11:06,567
Okay, gentlemen, let's get
our rules of the road straight.

1721
02:11:06,647 --> 02:11:10,197
We're going to a place
called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

1722
02:11:10,277 --> 02:11:13,207
Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel
are sympathetic to our dilemma.

1723
02:11:13,277 --> 02:11:15,177
The place is North Hollywood,

1724
02:11:15,247 --> 02:11:19,237
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.

1725
02:11:19,317 --> 02:11:22,647
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

1726
02:11:24,057 --> 02:11:25,987
Vincent, you follow
in my Acura.

1727
02:11:26,057 --> 02:11:29,997
Now, if we come across the path
of any John Q. Laws,

1728
02:11:30,067 --> 02:11:33,157
- nobody does a fuckin' thing
'til I do something.
- Right.

1729
02:11:33,237 --> 02:11:36,167
- What did I say?
- Don't do shit unless.

1730
02:11:36,237 --> 02:11:38,497
- Unless what?
- Unless you do it first.

1731
02:11:38,567 --> 02:11:41,007
Spoken like a true prodigy.

1732
02:11:41,077 --> 02:11:44,507
How about you, Lash LaRue?
Can you keep your spurs
from jingling and jangling?

1733
02:11:44,577 --> 02:11:48,677
The gun went off. I don't know why.
I'm cool. I promise you.

1734
02:11:48,747 --> 02:11:51,687
Fair enough. Now, I drive real
fuckin' fast, so keep up.

1735
02:11:51,747 --> 02:11:54,247
If get my car back
any different than I gave it,

1736
02:11:54,317 --> 02:11:57,257
Monster Joe's gonna be
disposing of two bodies.

1737
02:12:01,097 --> 02:12:02,787
Outta my way, Rex.

1738
02:12:04,367 --> 02:12:06,797
- We cool?
- Like it never happened.

1739
02:12:06,867 --> 02:12:10,637
- All right.
- Boys, this is Raquel.

1740
02:12:10,707 --> 02:12:13,327
Someday all this will be hers.

1741
02:12:13,407 --> 02:12:16,277
Hi. So, what's
with the outfits?

1742
02:12:16,347 --> 02:12:19,777
You guys going to
a volleyball game or something?

1743
02:12:19,847 --> 02:12:22,277
I'm takin' milady
out for breakfast.

1744
02:12:22,347 --> 02:12:25,117
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?

1745
02:12:25,187 --> 02:12:26,547
- Redondo.
- Inglewood.

1746
02:12:26,617 --> 02:12:30,057
It's ―
It's your future. I ―

1747
02:12:30,127 --> 02:12:32,887
I see a ―
a cab ride.

1748
02:12:32,957 --> 02:12:35,927
Move outta the sticks, fellas.
Say good night, Raquel.

1749
02:12:35,997 --> 02:12:38,927
- Good night, Raquel.
- I'll see you guys around.

1750
02:12:38,997 --> 02:12:41,437
Stay outta trouble,
you crazy kids.

1751
02:12:41,497 --> 02:12:45,437
Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was
a real pleasure watching you work.

1752
02:12:45,507 --> 02:12:48,437
Yeah, really.
And thank you very much, Mr. Wolf.

1753
02:12:48,507 --> 02:12:50,437
Call me Winston.

1754
02:12:52,007 --> 02:12:54,947
You see that, young lady? Respect.

1755
02:12:55,017 --> 02:12:59,217
- Respect for one's elders
shows character.
- I have character.

1756
02:12:59,287 --> 02:13:03,317
Because you are a character
doesn't mean that you have character.

1757
02:13:09,897 --> 02:13:12,827
Wanna share a cab?

1758
02:13:12,897 --> 02:13:17,167
I'd go for some breakfast.
Feel like havin' breakfast with me?

1759
02:13:17,237 --> 02:13:20,037
Cool.

1760
02:13:24,077 --> 02:13:27,167
I don't know why, I just thought
he'd be European or something.

1761
02:13:27,247 --> 02:13:30,677
- Yeah, he's about as European
as fuckin' English Bob.
- I know that now.

1762
02:13:30,747 --> 02:13:33,187
- But was he cool or what?
- Thank you.

1763
02:13:33,257 --> 02:13:35,687
Totally fuckin' cool,
in control.

1764
02:13:35,757 --> 02:13:39,807
Didn't even really get pissed when you
were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.

1765
02:13:39,897 --> 02:13:42,477
Want some bacon?

1766
02:13:42,557 --> 02:13:44,497
No, man, I don't eat pork.

1767
02:13:44,567 --> 02:13:47,987
- Are you Jewish?
- I ain't Jewish; I just don't
dig on swine, that's all.

1768
02:13:48,067 --> 02:13:50,997
- Why not?
- Pigs are filthy animals.

1769
02:13:51,067 --> 02:13:52,997
I don't eat filthy animals.

1770
02:13:53,077 --> 02:13:56,497
Yeah, but bacon tastes good.
Pork chops taste good.

1771
02:13:56,567 --> 02:13:59,497
Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie,
but I'd never know ...

1772
02:13:59,577 --> 02:14:02,507
'cause I wouldn't eat
the filthy motherfuckers.

1773
02:14:02,567 --> 02:14:05,507
Pigs sleep and root in shit.
That's a filthy animal.

1774
02:14:05,577 --> 02:14:09,507
I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got
sense enough to disregard its own feces.

1775
02:14:09,577 --> 02:14:13,917
- What about a dog?
Dog eats its own feces.
- I don't eat dog either.

1776
02:14:13,987 --> 02:14:17,317
Yeah, but do you consider
a dog to be a filthy animal?

1777
02:14:17,387 --> 02:14:20,317
I wouldn't go so far
as to call a dog filthy,

1778
02:14:20,387 --> 02:14:22,327
but they're definitely dirty.

1779
02:14:22,387 --> 02:14:26,517
- But a dog's got personality.
Personality goes a long way.
- Ah, so, by that rationale,

1780
02:14:26,597 --> 02:14:30,157
if a pig had a better personality,
he would cease to be a filthy animal.

1781
02:14:30,237 --> 02:14:34,167
- Is that true?
- We'd have to be talkin' about
one charming motherfuckin' pig.

1782
02:14:34,237 --> 02:14:38,267
I mean, he'd have to be
ten times more charming than
that Arnold on Green Acres.

1783
02:14:43,877 --> 02:14:46,007
Oh, man, that's good.

1784
02:14:46,077 --> 02:14:49,677
That's good, man.
You're startin' to lighten up.

1785
02:14:49,757 --> 02:14:52,747
You've been sittin' there,
all serious and shit.

1786
02:14:52,827 --> 02:14:55,257
- I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.
- About what?

1787
02:14:55,327 --> 02:14:58,257
- About the miracle we witnessed.
- Miracle you witnessed.

1788
02:14:58,327 --> 02:15:01,597
- I witnessed a freak occurrence.
- What is a miracle, Vincent?

1789
02:15:03,497 --> 02:15:06,697
- Act of God.
- And what's an act of God?

1790
02:15:10,177 --> 02:15:14,007
When, um, God makes
the impossible possible.

1791
02:15:15,047 --> 02:15:16,977
But this morning ...

1792
02:15:17,047 --> 02:15:19,777
- I don't think qualifies.
- Hey, Vincent.

1793
02:15:19,847 --> 02:15:23,547
See, that shit don't matter.
You're judging this shit the wrong way.

1794
02:15:23,617 --> 02:15:28,557
It could be God stopped the bullets,
changed Coke to Pepsi,
found my car keys.

1795
02:15:28,627 --> 02:15:31,617
You don't judge shit like this
based on merit.

1796
02:15:31,697 --> 02:15:34,127
Now, whether or not
what we experienced ...

1797
02:15:34,197 --> 02:15:37,357
was an according-to-Hoyle miracle
is insignificant.

1798
02:15:37,437 --> 02:15:41,197
But what is significant is,
I felt the touch of God.

1799
02:15:41,267 --> 02:15:43,207
God got involved.

1800
02:15:43,277 --> 02:15:44,997
But why?

1801
02:15:45,077 --> 02:15:48,097
Well, that's what's fuckin' with me:
I don't know why.

1802
02:15:48,177 --> 02:15:51,147
- But I can't go back to sleep.
- You're serious.

1803
02:15:51,217 --> 02:15:53,147
You're really thinkin'
about quittin'.

1804
02:15:53,217 --> 02:15:55,877
- For life? Most definitely.
- Yeah.

1805
02:15:55,947 --> 02:15:59,317
Fuck.
What you gonna do then?

1806
02:16:00,627 --> 02:16:04,857
Well, that's what I been
sitting here contemplating.

1807
02:16:04,927 --> 02:16:08,527
First I'm gonna deliver
this case to Marsellus.

1808
02:16:08,597 --> 02:16:11,687
Then, basically, I'm just
gonna walk the Earth.

1809
02:16:11,767 --> 02:16:15,207
- What you mean, "walk the Earth"?
- Like Caine in Kung Fu.

1810
02:16:15,267 --> 02:16:18,237
Walk from place to place,
meet people, get in adventures.

1811
02:16:18,307 --> 02:16:20,567
And how long do you intend
to walk the Earth?

1812
02:16:20,647 --> 02:16:23,937
- 'Til God puts me
where He wants me to be.
- What if He don't do that?

1813
02:16:24,017 --> 02:16:28,947
- If it takes forever,
then I'll walk forever.
- So you decided to be a bum.

1814
02:16:29,017 --> 02:16:32,667
I'll just be Jules, Vincent.
No more, no less.

1815
02:16:32,757 --> 02:16:34,727
No, Jules,
you decided to be a bum,

1816
02:16:34,787 --> 02:16:38,077
just like all those pieces of shit
out there who beg for change,

1817
02:16:38,157 --> 02:16:41,087
who sleep in garbage bins,
eat what I throw away.

1818
02:16:41,167 --> 02:16:44,137
They got a name for that, Jules.
It's called a bum.

1819
02:16:44,197 --> 02:16:47,857
And without a job,
a residence or legal tender,
that's what you're gonna be, man.

1820
02:16:47,937 --> 02:16:49,857
You're gonna be
a fuckin' bum.

1821
02:16:49,937 --> 02:16:52,867
Look, my friend,
this is just where you and I differ.

1822
02:16:52,937 --> 02:16:55,767
Garçon! Coffee!

1823
02:16:55,837 --> 02:17:00,327
Jules, look, what happened this morning,
man, I agree it was peculiar.

1824
02:17:00,417 --> 02:17:03,537
- But water into wine, I ―
- All shapes and sizes, Vincent.

1825
02:17:03,617 --> 02:17:06,707
- Don't fuckin' talk
to me that way, man.
- If my answers frighten you,

1826
02:17:06,777 --> 02:17:09,377
then you should cease
asking scary questions.

1827
02:17:12,247 --> 02:17:14,187
I'm gonna take a shit.

1828
02:17:17,057 --> 02:17:20,807
Let me ask you something.

1829
02:17:20,937 --> 02:17:23,067
When did you make this decision?
When you were sittin' there
eatin' that muffin?

1830
02:17:23,137 --> 02:17:27,077
Yeah. I was sittin' here
eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee,

1831
02:17:27,147 --> 02:17:29,077
replayin' the incident
in my head,

1832
02:17:29,147 --> 02:17:32,947
when I had what alcoholics refer to
as a moment of clarity.

1833
02:17:33,017 --> 02:17:36,147
Fuck. To be continued.

1834
02:17:48,167 --> 02:17:51,097
- I love you, Pumpkin.
- I love you, Honey Bunny.

1835
02:17:52,707 --> 02:17:55,637
- Everybody be cool!
This is a robbery!

1836
02:17:55,707 --> 02:18:00,697
Any one of you fucking pricks move,
and I'll execute every one
of you motherfuckers!

1837
02:18:00,777 --> 02:18:04,177
- You got that?
You just be quiet over there!
- Waitresses on the floor!

1838
02:18:04,247 --> 02:18:07,307
Get on the fuckin' ―
Get the fuck down!

1839
02:18:07,387 --> 02:18:12,117
You're in a blind spot.
Take your dames over to that booth,
on the count of ten!

1840
02:18:12,187 --> 02:18:16,757
- Mexicans, out of
the fucking kitchen!
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ―

1841
02:18:16,827 --> 02:18:19,927
What the fuck are you doing,
you fucking yuppie? Get down!

1842
02:18:19,997 --> 02:18:22,467
- Get down!
- Throw those bags!

1843
02:18:22,537 --> 02:18:25,027
Fucking move! Move!

1844
02:18:25,107 --> 02:18:27,367
Move! Get the fuck ―

1845
02:18:27,437 --> 02:18:30,467
Get down on the fucking floor!

1846
02:18:30,547 --> 02:18:32,477
Grandpa! Down!

1847
02:18:32,547 --> 02:18:35,907
I'm the manager here, and there's
no problem. No problem at all.

1848
02:18:35,977 --> 02:18:38,917
- You gonna give me a problem?
- No, sir, I'm not.

1849
02:18:38,987 --> 02:18:43,007
Thought you said you were gonna
give me a fucking problem!

1850
02:18:43,087 --> 02:18:47,787
- I think we got
a hero here, Honey Bunny.
- Well, just execute him!

1851
02:18:47,857 --> 02:18:49,797
I am not a hero.

1852
02:18:49,857 --> 02:18:52,887
- I'm just a coffee shop manager.
- Get the fuck down!

1853
02:18:52,967 --> 02:18:54,727
The restaurant's ours!

1854
02:18:54,797 --> 02:18:57,737
Just take whatever you want.

1855
02:18:57,807 --> 02:18:59,737
- You talk to the customers.
- Yeah.

1856
02:18:59,807 --> 02:19:02,937
You tell them to be fucking cool
and everything will be over.

1857
02:19:03,007 --> 02:19:04,977
- You understand me?
- Yes!

1858
02:19:07,277 --> 02:19:09,077
Listen, everybody.

1859
02:19:09,147 --> 02:19:11,177
Be calm, cooperate,

1860
02:19:11,247 --> 02:19:14,187
and this'll all be over
in a minute!

1861
02:19:14,257 --> 02:19:16,217
Get the fuck down!
Well done.

1862
02:19:28,567 --> 02:19:31,997
All right, now, people, gonna
come around and collect your wallets!

1863
02:19:32,067 --> 02:19:35,517
You don't fucking talk. You just
throw 'em in the bag! Are we clear?

1864
02:19:35,607 --> 02:19:37,827
I said, are we fucking clear?

1865
02:19:37,907 --> 02:19:40,837
Good!
Now, wallets out!

1866
02:19:40,917 --> 02:19:44,497
That's it.
Get the fuck down. In the bag.

1867
02:19:44,587 --> 02:19:47,507
- In the fucking bag!
- I don't
have nothin' on me, man.

1868
02:19:47,587 --> 02:19:49,437
In the bag.

1869
02:19:49,517 --> 02:19:52,447
What am I waiting for?
ln the fucking bag.

1870
02:19:52,527 --> 02:19:55,447
Laura. Laura. Tips.
In the bag.

1871
02:19:55,517 --> 02:19:57,747
- Is that a cellular phone?
- Yeah.

1872
02:19:57,827 --> 02:19:59,757
In the fucking bag.

1873
02:20:01,337 --> 02:20:04,777
Tidy up, tidy up, that's it.
Now get the fuck down on the floor.

1874
02:20:04,857 --> 02:20:07,297
In the bag.
In the bag.

1875
02:20:19,477 --> 02:20:21,407
In the bag.

1876
02:20:36,527 --> 02:20:39,457
- What's in the case?
- My boss's dirty laundry.

1877
02:20:39,527 --> 02:20:42,057
- Your boss makes you do his laundry?
- When he wants it clean.

1878
02:20:42,127 --> 02:20:44,827
- Sounds like a shit job.
- Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.

1879
02:20:44,897 --> 02:20:47,837
- Open it.
- 'Fraid I can't do that.

1880
02:20:49,867 --> 02:20:52,237
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes, you did.

1881
02:20:53,307 --> 02:20:55,637
What's going on?

1882
02:20:55,707 --> 02:20:59,167
- Looks like we got
a vigilante in our midst.
- Shoot him in the face!

1883
02:20:59,247 --> 02:21:02,977
I hate to shatter your ego,
but this ain't the first time
I've had a gun pointed at me.

1884
02:21:03,047 --> 02:21:06,457
- If you don't take your hand off
that case, it'll be your last.
- Stop causing problems!

1885
02:21:06,517 --> 02:21:09,317
You'll get us all killed! Give 'em
what you got and get 'em outta here!

1886
02:21:09,387 --> 02:21:13,627
Shut the fuck up, fat man! This ain't
none of your goddamn business!

1887
02:21:13,697 --> 02:21:15,927
Be cool, Honey Bunny, be cool.

1888
02:21:15,997 --> 02:21:18,087
No problem.
I got it under control.

1889
02:21:19,667 --> 02:21:21,657
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

1890
02:21:23,267 --> 02:21:27,207
If you don't open that case,
I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.

1891
02:21:31,617 --> 02:21:33,547
We clear?

1892
02:21:36,687 --> 02:21:38,617
One.

1893
02:21:40,457 --> 02:21:42,977
Two.

1894
02:21:43,057 --> 02:21:45,117
- Three.
- Okay, Ringo.

1895
02:21:45,197 --> 02:21:47,257
You win.

1896
02:21:47,327 --> 02:21:49,267
It's yours.

1897
02:21:53,297 --> 02:21:56,027
Open it.

1898
02:21:59,907 --> 02:22:02,137
Hey, what is it?

1899
02:22:02,207 --> 02:22:04,547
What is it?

1900
02:22:04,617 --> 02:22:07,207
Is that what I think it is?

1901
02:22:07,277 --> 02:22:09,977
Mm-hmm.

1902
02:22:11,557 --> 02:22:13,677
It's beautiful.

1903
02:22:13,757 --> 02:22:16,317
Goddamn it, what is it?

1904
02:22:17,797 --> 02:22:20,727
You let him go!
You let him go!

1905
02:22:20,797 --> 02:22:23,767
- Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!
- Tell that bitch to be cool.

1906
02:22:23,827 --> 02:22:26,767
- Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
- Be cool! Be cool!

1907
02:22:26,837 --> 02:22:29,567
- Tell that bitch to chill!
- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!

1908
02:22:29,637 --> 02:22:32,537
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

1909
02:22:32,607 --> 02:22:34,407
- Let go of him!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

1910
02:22:34,477 --> 02:22:37,397
- Now, promise her
it's gonna be all right!
- I promise!

1911
02:22:37,477 --> 02:22:39,377
- Tell her to chill!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

1912
02:22:39,447 --> 02:22:41,377
- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.

1913
02:22:41,447 --> 02:22:44,877
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not
gonna do anything stupid, are we?

1914
02:22:44,957 --> 02:22:47,877
- Don't you hurt him!
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!

1915
02:22:47,957 --> 02:22:51,437
We're all gonna be like three little
Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like?

1916
02:22:51,527 --> 02:22:55,177
- Come on, Yolanda!
What's Fonzie like?
- He's cool.

1917
02:22:55,267 --> 02:22:57,187
- What?
- Cool.

1918
02:22:57,267 --> 02:23:00,087
Correctamundo.
And that's what we're gonna be.

1919
02:23:00,167 --> 02:23:02,097
We're gonna be cool.

1920
02:23:02,157 --> 02:23:07,067
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.

1921
02:23:07,127 --> 02:23:09,227
And when I count three,

1922
02:23:09,297 --> 02:23:12,237
I want you to
let go of your gun,

1923
02:23:12,307 --> 02:23:15,757
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.

1924
02:23:16,837 --> 02:23:18,897
And when you do it,

1925
02:23:18,977 --> 02:23:21,037
you do it cool.

1926
02:23:21,117 --> 02:23:23,447
You ready?

1927
02:23:23,517 --> 02:23:25,607
One,

1928
02:23:25,687 --> 02:23:27,877
two,

1929
02:23:27,957 --> 02:23:29,887
three.

1930
02:23:36,857 --> 02:23:39,987
- Okay, now you let him go!
- Yolanda!

1931
02:23:40,067 --> 02:23:43,657
I thought you were gonna
be cool. Now, when you yell
at me, it makes me nervous.

1932
02:23:43,737 --> 02:23:45,827
When I get nervous,
I get scared.

1933
02:23:45,907 --> 02:23:49,737
When motherfuckers get scared,
that's when motherfuckers
accidentally get shot.

1934
02:23:51,377 --> 02:23:55,007
Just know, you hurt him, you die.

1935
02:23:55,077 --> 02:23:58,477
Well, that seems to be
the situation.

1936
02:23:58,547 --> 02:24:00,487
But I don't want that.

1937
02:24:00,547 --> 02:24:02,487
And you don't want that.

1938
02:24:02,557 --> 02:24:05,287
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

1939
02:24:05,357 --> 02:24:07,447
So let's see what we can do.

1940
02:24:09,857 --> 02:24:13,097
Now ... here's the situation.

1941
02:24:13,167 --> 02:24:17,037
Normally both your asses would be
dead as fuckin' fried chicken,

1942
02:24:17,097 --> 02:24:20,537
but you happened to pull this shit
while I'm in a transitional period,

1943
02:24:20,607 --> 02:24:23,537
and I don't wanna kill you;
I wanna help you.

1944
02:24:23,607 --> 02:24:27,547
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

1945
02:24:27,617 --> 02:24:30,547
Besides, I been through too much shit
over this case this morning ...

1946
02:24:30,617 --> 02:24:33,547
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

1947
02:24:33,617 --> 02:24:35,487
Vincent!

1948
02:24:35,557 --> 02:24:38,487
- Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
- Get back!

1949
02:24:38,557 --> 02:24:41,257
It's cool!
We still just talkin'.

1950
02:24:41,327 --> 02:24:45,487
Come on. Point the gun at me.
Point the gun at me. There you go.

1951
02:24:45,567 --> 02:24:47,627
Now, Vincent, you just hang back ...

1952
02:24:47,697 --> 02:24:49,637
and don't do
a goddamn thing.

1953
02:24:49,697 --> 02:24:51,637
Tell her it's still cool.

1954
02:24:51,707 --> 02:24:54,637
- It's still cool, Honey Bunny.
- How we doin', baby?

1955
02:24:56,037 --> 02:24:58,707
I ― I gotta go pee.

1956
02:24:58,777 --> 02:25:00,707
I wanna go home.

1957
02:25:00,777 --> 02:25:04,377
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you.

1958
02:25:04,447 --> 02:25:07,387
It's almost over.
Tell her you're proud of her.

1959
02:25:07,447 --> 02:25:10,817
- I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.
- I love you.

1960
02:25:10,887 --> 02:25:14,047
- I love you too, Honey Bunny.
- Now,

1961
02:25:14,127 --> 02:25:18,057
I want you to go in that bag
and find my wallet.

1962
02:25:20,597 --> 02:25:24,527
- Which one is it?
- It's the one that says
"Bad Motherfucker."

1963
02:25:38,797 --> 02:25:41,347
That's it.
That's my bad motherfucker.

1964
02:25:41,427 --> 02:25:44,517
Open it up.
Take out the money.

1965
02:25:49,577 --> 02:25:51,727
Count it.

1966
02:25:58,047 --> 02:26:00,567
How much is there?

1967
02:26:02,477 --> 02:26:04,407
About 1,500 dollars.

1968
02:26:04,477 --> 02:26:07,677
Okay, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

1969
02:26:07,747 --> 02:26:10,947
Now, with the rest
of those wallets and the register,

1970
02:26:11,017 --> 02:26:13,107
that makes this a pretty successful
little score, huh?

1971
02:26:13,187 --> 02:26:17,087
Jules, you give that fuckin'
nimrod 1,500 dollars, and I'll
shoot him on general principle.

1972
02:26:17,157 --> 02:26:20,597
No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna
do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!

1973
02:26:20,657 --> 02:26:22,757
Vince, shut the fuck up!

1974
02:26:22,827 --> 02:26:26,697
- Shut up!
- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.

1975
02:26:26,767 --> 02:26:29,697
Now, I ain't givin' it
to him, Vincent.

1976
02:26:29,767 --> 02:26:31,707
I'm buyin' something
for my money.

1977
02:26:32,937 --> 02:26:36,137
- Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?
- What?

1978
02:26:36,207 --> 02:26:40,947
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't have to kill your ass.

1979
02:26:41,017 --> 02:26:43,707
You read the Bible, Ringo?

1980
02:26:44,787 --> 02:26:46,717
Not regularly, no.

1981
02:26:46,787 --> 02:26:49,217
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

1982
02:26:49,287 --> 02:26:52,817
Ezekiel 25:17.

1983
02:26:52,897 --> 02:26:55,727
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides ...

1984
02:26:55,797 --> 02:26:57,727
by the inequities
of the selfish ...

1985
02:26:57,797 --> 02:26:59,727
and the tyranny of evil men.

1986
02:26:59,797 --> 02:27:03,167
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and good will,

1987
02:27:03,237 --> 02:27:05,667
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

1988
02:27:05,737 --> 02:27:09,837
for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.

1989
02:27:09,907 --> 02:27:14,207
And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger ...

1990
02:27:14,277 --> 02:27:17,337
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

1991
02:27:17,417 --> 02:27:20,447
And you will know
I am the Lord ...

1992
02:27:20,517 --> 02:27:24,077
when I lay My vengeance
upon you."

1993
02:27:25,157 --> 02:27:27,597
I been sayin' that shit for years,

1994
02:27:27,657 --> 02:27:30,827
and if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

1995
02:27:30,897 --> 02:27:33,837
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

1996
02:27:33,897 --> 02:27:36,837
I just thought it was some cold-blooded
shit to say to a motherfucker ...

1997
02:27:36,907 --> 02:27:39,337
before I popped a cap
in his ass.

1998
02:27:39,407 --> 02:27:42,837
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.

1999
02:27:42,907 --> 02:27:45,847
See, now I'm thinkin'
maybe it means ...

2000
02:27:45,917 --> 02:27:50,777
you're the evil man,
and I'm the righteous man,

2001
02:27:50,847 --> 02:27:53,787
and Mr. 9-millimeter here,
he's the shepherd ...

2002
02:27:53,857 --> 02:27:57,417
protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness.

2003
02:27:57,487 --> 02:27:59,427
Or it could mean ...

2004
02:27:59,497 --> 02:28:02,927
you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd,

2005
02:28:02,997 --> 02:28:06,937
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2006
02:28:06,997 --> 02:28:09,267
Now, I'd like that.

2007
02:28:09,337 --> 02:28:12,237
But that shit
ain't the truth.

2008
02:28:12,307 --> 02:28:14,167
The truth is,

2009
02:28:15,237 --> 02:28:17,177
you're the weak ...

2010
02:28:18,577 --> 02:28:21,977
and I'm the tyranny
of evil men.

2011
02:28:23,387 --> 02:28:25,317
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2012
02:28:26,587 --> 02:28:29,517
I'm tryin' real hard ...

2013
02:28:29,587 --> 02:28:31,857
to be the shepherd.

2014
02:28:47,177 --> 02:28:49,097
Go.

2015
02:29:06,787 --> 02:29:09,217
I think we should be
leaving now.

2016
02:29:09,297 --> 02:29:12,217
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
