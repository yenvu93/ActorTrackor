                       David Marconi
                            and

     <b>FADE IN:</b>

     <b>EXT. SHENANDOAH NATIONAL PARK, SCENIC VIEW LOT - MORNING</b>

     Shenandoah mountains. A cold dawn. TWO BLACK TOWN CARS
     sit side by side, facing a view of a farming valley below.

     Two MEN in dark suits and long coats stand near the
     cars, casually on the lookout. If we caught a glimpse
     underneath the coat of the taller of the two, we'd see
     that he was carrying a 9mm. Glock.
<a href="http://www.dailyscript.com/"><img src="scence_files/eots.gif" border="0"></a>
     <b>INT. BLACK TOWN CAR - CONTINUOUS</b>

     In the backseat of the car sit HAMERSLEY and REYNOLDS,
     each well-kept and in his early 50's.

<b>                        REYNOLDS
</b>            "I know thy works and thy labour
            and how thou canst not bear them
            that are evil. And thou hast tried
            them who say they are apostles and
            hast found them to be liars".
            Revelations II.

<b>                        HAMERSLEY
</b>            What the hell does it mean?

<b>                        REYNOLDS
</b>            It means who's side are you on?

<b>                        HAMERSLEY
</b>            You didn't ask me to meet you 30
            miles from my office for a Bible
            study class.

<b>                        REYNOLDS
</b>            It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone
            needs to swallow hard. No one,
            including you, wants to be fingered
            as the one obstructing efforts to
            crack down on terrorism, and--

<b>                        HAMERSLEY
</b>            Fuck you.

<b>                        REYNOLDS
</b>            What?

<b>                        HAMERSLEY
</b>            I said fuck you.

<b>                        REYNOLDS
</b>            Is that anyway to talk to an old
            school chum?

<b>                        HAMERSLEY
</b>            You're gonna finger me as soft on
            terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you
            unconscionable asshole?

<b>                        REYNOLDS
</b>            There are planes falling out of the
            sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i>
            buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs
            in the mail. What are we gonna do!?

<b>                        HAMERSLEY
</b>            We're not gonna hand you and your
            band of lunatics the keys to the
            kingdom. I'm not gonna sit in
            Congress and write a law that
            allows the NSA to point a camera
            and a microphone at anything they
            damn well feel like. And the next
            time you have something to say to
            me, we do it above-board, in my
            office, like everyone else. Now get
            outa my car, I've got a committee
            meeting on the hill.

     REYNOLDS regards HAMERSLEY a moment, then opens the car
     door--

     <b>EXT. PARKWAY - MORNING</b>

     HAMERSLEY's car snakes down the twisting mountain road.

     <b>INT. HAMERSLEY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS</b>

     HAMERSLEY MAKES VERBAL NOTES concerning the Reynolds
     meeting into his memo-recorder as he drives. He picks
     up his cellular phone and punches in a number.

<b>                        VOICE (O.S.)
</b>            Senator Albert's office--

     The line goes dead.

     HAMERSLEY tries again but can't get a dial tone. Then,
     in the rear-view mirror, a BROWN SEDAN gains fast.
     Whoever the guy is, he's flying. Then a man with a
     rifle leans out the sedan's window. Aims.

     HAMERSLEY flies into a blind curve. Tires SCREECH as he
     rounds the bend to see

     A PROPANE TRUCK. Blocking both lanes of the road.

     HAMERSLEY's eyes widen. He stomps the brakes, SKIDS and
     SLAMS into the truck. The EXPLOSION engulfs everything.
     HAMERSLEY and the car are consumed. The pursuing sedan
     slows to a stop. The men watch. The car's an inferno.

     The MEN pull a 'U' and drive away.

     <b>INT. CRYSTAL CITY, VIRGINIA, TALL OFFICE BLDG. - DAY</b>

     A well-appointed big-city law office filled with
     citations of merit and pictures of a wife and child.

     ROBERT DEAN, a likable young lawyer, sits behind his
     desk with his back to an OLDER MAN. He stares at a
     commanding view of Washington, D.C. as he listens to a
     tired, smoke and whiskey voice.

<b>                        OLDER MAN (L.T.)
</b>            I don't know how much longer we can
            hold out, Mr. Dean.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I don't know, either, L.T. Maybe
            you guys should get yourself a
            labor lawyer.

<b>                        L.T.
</b>            Well that's why I'm here, Mr. Dean.
            'Cause you're a labor lawyer.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Good point.

<b>                        L.T.
</b>            Last night, Larry Spinks, he works
            the Steel Press, he goes to a bar
            with his wife Rosalie to have a
            glass of chianti 'cause it's his
            birthday, and these two guys, these
            Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him
            when he goes to the bathroom.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            L.T., in this office I'd prefer you
            say Italian-Americans.

<b>                        L.T.
</b>            I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in
            St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm
            not myself. The Union bosses say
            unless we take Bellmoth's offer,
            it'll only get worse.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            That's because your Union bosses
            <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.

<b>                        L.T.
</b>            I don't under--

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            The Union's trying to railroad you
            into accepting terms worse than
            what you have now.

<b>                        L.T.
</b>            Why would the Union--

     DEAN swivels around in his chair and faces L.T.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Because they've been paid off by
            Bellmoth.

<b>                        L.T.
</b>            Mr. Dean--

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            My name's Bobby. I'm your lawyer.
            Don't do anything 'till I talk to you.

     DEAN gets up and walks a grateful L.T. to the door,
     calling to his secretary as they go--

<b>                        DEAN (CONT'D)
</b>               (calling)
            Martha!

     MARTHA appears in the doorway...

     ZAVITZ disconnects a video digitizer, removes a game-
     cartridge containing the digitized video...

     ...and inserts it into a Gameboy.

     He steps to the door and eyes the peep-hole.

     ZAVITZ POV: A fish-eye view of a Fed-Ex man, JONES,
     looking bored.

<b>                        ZAVITZ
</b>            Can you tell me who it's from?

</b>            Can you--would it be possible to
            leave it by the door?

<b>                        JONES

</b>               (stepping to the window)
            All right. Okay. Just give me a minute.

     ZAVITZ POV: TWO DWP INSTALLERS hovering in a bucket
     across the street. Down below, a cargo van with a
     multiple roof antenna is double parked near a Fed-Ex
     van. Then--

     --Through a street window's reflection, ZAVITZ sees his
     building's front entrance. SEVERAL TENANTS are being
     prevented from entering by TWO MEN, plain clothes, one
     with a radio communicator pressed to his ear.

     Shit.

     ZAVITZ backs from the window, seized by panic. He grabs
     his phone...

     ...dead.

     He picks up his fax line. Also dead.

     He grabs the GameBoy, goes to a small side window and
     opens it. A ledge snakes around the corner. An athlete
     he's not but there's no choice. He squeezes out.

     <b>INT. ZAVITZ BLDG. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS</b>

     PRATT, wearing a Fed-Ex uniform, is laying in wait.

            is out the window.

     PRATT sprints down the hall, pulling out his pistol, as

     JONES kicks in Zavitz's door and rushes in. The
     window's open. JONES looks out as the last of ZAVITZ
     goes around the corner of the ledge.

<b>                        RADIO VOICE (O.S.)

     <b>EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS</b>

     It's the rooftop ZAVITZ is heading to. Two MEN crouch
     behind a wall, watching ZAVITZ approach.

<b>                        MAN #1
</b>               (into headset)
            We'll take delivery from here.

     ZAVITZ inches along, scared breathless. He looks back.

     No one.

     Maybe he was wrong.

     A pigeon suddenly flies by...ZAVITZ loses his balance,
     struggles...and falls.

     He crashes through an awning and into a sidewalk fruit
     stand.

     Dazed, ZAVITZ crawls to his feet as passersby watch
     speechless.

     Things happen fast. The cargo van rips from the curb
     but is suddenly blocked by a delivery truck. HORNS BLAST.

     HICKS, 30's and athletic, leaps from the van.

     Fears confirmed, ZAVITZ starts down the sidewalk,
     shakes off pain, and moves to a run.

     Except now there's someone in front of him. He's
     trapped. Reaching a doorway, ZAVITZ pushes. The door
     opens to--

     <b>INT. RESTAURANT SUPPLY SHOP - CONTINUOUS</b>

     ZAVITZ charges through and kicks open a fire door. An
     alarm blasts as he exits to--

     <b>EXT. ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS</b>

     A garbage truck screams up the alley. There's no way to
     outrun it. There's a fire escape above a dumpster.
     Breath rasping, he struggles on the dumpster, pulling
     himself up the ladder just as the truck OBLITERATES all
     below.

     ZAVITZ struggles and climbs. Reaching a landing, he
     pauses for breath...

     ...and sees HICKS and two others just moments behind.
     ZAVITZ grabs a fire escape door, tugs, pulls and bangs
     it open to--

     <b>INT. A DILAPIDATED HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS</b>

     ZAVITZ hurtles by, trips, get up, runs again, adrenaline
     pumping as PURSUING SOUNDS near. He pitches down a
     staircase, shoves TWO PEOPLE and rips through--

     He flies past the diners and exits into--

     <b>EXT. BUSY STREET - CONTINUOUS</b>

     HICKS and ANOTHER fly out of the diner, just in time to
     see ZAVITZ melting in with Christmas shoppers that are
     entering a department store.

     We see that the large sign over the entrance to the
     store reads: "HARRISON'S".

     <b>INT. HARRISON'S DEPARTMENT STORE - EVENING</b>

     An upscale store packed with Christmas shoppers.

     At a fashion ramp, a small crowd of mostly WOMEN have
     gathered to watch leggy models feature a particular
     line of lingerie. Mixed in among this group is DEAN, a
     shopping bag in each hand, his briefcase tucked under
     one arm, trying his best to affect an air of the
     studious shopper.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Okay.

     The SALES CLERK goes around the counter to the rear
     area. DEAN glances at the fashion show when he glimpses--

     ZAVITZ, hurrying through the women's dressing area,
     desperately looking for an exit. No luck. ZAVITZ moves
     toward DEAN, about to break for the front, but HICKS is
     there searching. Trapped, ZAVITZ ducks behind a display.

     DEAN watches, unaware of ZAVITZ's pursuers. Then it
     clicks...

     DEAN looks around...

     ...ZAVITZ is gone.

     Out on the street, ZAVITZ shoves into a group of
     shoppers waiting for the light. Then he sees HICKS and
     his PARTNER. They see him.

     Fuck the light.

     ZAVITZ runs into the street as--

     --a BUS speeds through yellow. ZAVITZ is caught in its
     path.

<b>     BAM!
</b>
     Only stunned witnesses remain.

     DEAN exits the department store. He sees the commotion
     and makes his way over.

     SIRENS can be heard in the distance. DEAN eyes the
     ground where the body lays. He sees Zavitz's BLOODY

</b>            I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident
            was outside. It was a bus.

<b>                        MORELOS
</b>            Someone said you spoke to Mr.
            Zavitz before he died. I thought
            you might know something.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            About what?

<b>                        MORELOS
</b>            About the accident.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I'm no expert, but I'm assuming
            that the impact of a moving bus
            against his body caused--

<b>                        MORELOS
</b>            Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            What kind of trouble.

<b>                        MORELOS
</b>            You tell me.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I can't.

<b>                        MORELOS
</b>            Are you invoking attorney/client
            privilege.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I'm not his attorney.

<b>                        MORELOS
</b>            Than why can't you tell me.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Because I don't know.

<b>                        MORELOS
</b>            I'm just trying to determine if Mr.
            Zavitz was involved in something
            more than a simple bus accident.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Than why don't you talk to the bus
            driver?

<b>                        MORELOS
</b>            Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Somebody took my blender.

<b>                        MORELOS
</b>            We'd appreciate your cooperation.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I'm happy to help you all I can.
            But I didn't see the accident and I
            barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've
            gotta go to work.

     DEAN starts walking--MORELOS follows him.

<b>                        MORELOS
</b>            Did he give you anything?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            No.

<b>                        MORELOS
</b>            Anything at all?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            No, sir.

<b>                        MORELOS
</b>            Was he with anyone?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Not that I could see.

<b>                        MORELOS
</b>            Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            No.

<b>                        MORELOS
</b>            Why'd you go to Harrison's?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            To buy lingerie.

<b>                        MORELOS
</b>            For your wife?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            <u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell
            kinds of questions are these.

<b>                        MORELOS
</b>            I thought maybe it might be for
            Rachel Banks.

     DEAN stops short and turns to MORELOS. He stares.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I don't know what's goin' on with
            Zavitz, but that was way, <u>way</u> outa
            line.

<b>                        MORELOS
</b>            Yes sir.

     DEAN steps into the elevator.

            and there should be a file.

     DEAN enters his office and turns his computer on. It
     BEEPS, BOOTS and loads.

     <b>INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS</b>

     LEVIN approaches the men's room. A MAINTENANCE MAN
     cleans up broken glass and water by the door. A sign
     reads: CLOSED FOR MAINTENANCE. Levin turns and leaves.

     Two more MAINTENANCE MEN kneel in a stall adjusting a

     antenna using slow, sweeping motions.

     CLOSE ON THE MONITOR displaying the intercepted signal.
     It's Dean's computer screen with text being typed in.
     The words are hard to read due to horizontal drift.
     After adjusting the antenna, the signal smooths.

     We PUSH CLOSER. The signal shows the current display of
     Dean's computer screen. We see Dean's O.S. command pull
     up his E-Mail. A prompt asks for a password.

     XXXXXXX appears.

     A switch is flipped. XXXXXXX becomes PUCCINI. Dean's

</b>            Yeah.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            He got hit by a bus.

     ANOTHER ATTORNEY sits several rows back, watching the

<b>                        DEAN (O.S.)

     reveals the tip of a concealed microphone.

<b>                        LEVIN (O.S.)

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I went through this with an

<b>                        PRATT
</b>            Mr. Zavitz was involved in an
            extortion scheme. We believe he
            passed you sensitive materials,
            possibly with your knowledge, and
            we need to--

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            He didn't.

<b>                        PRATT
</b>            We believe he did.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            You're wrong.

<b>                        PRATT
</b>            We have good reason to believe that
            he passed you--

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            If he passed me materials, I'd have
            them. I don't.

<b>                        REYNOLDS

</b>            I have a professional relationship

            Rachel Banks four years ago.

<b>                        DEAN

     Establishing. The Baltimore water front. A crusty bar
     overlooking the bay.

     <b>INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS</b>

     Sunlight slashes blinds revealing a place that is wrong
     during the day. JIMMY, a beefy bartender, takes stock
     of the liquor while RACHEL sits in a dark booth.

</b>            Rachel?

     RACHEL looks up...

</b>            Good. You're just what I need right
            now.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            You got a minute?

<b>                        RACHEL
</b>               (getting up)
            It's really not a good idea for me
            to be seen with you.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Who's doing this?

<b>                        RACHEL

            Will you hang on just a second.

<b>                        JERRY

     She looks at DEAN for a moment...

</b>            No. No problem.
               (to DEAN)
            Outside.

     <b>EXT. HARBOR CENTER - DAY</b>

     CLOSE ON a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA on a pole, sweeping,
     making automatic lens corrections.

</b>            There's a lot of people asking
            questions about you and me.

     We drift down to the harbor walkway, a greenbelt with
     quaint hotels and bars on one side, Chesapeake Bay on
     the other. DEAN and RACHEL are strolling the walk.

     DEAN and RACHEL on their stroll--

<b>                        RACHEL
</b>            Fuck you. When you needed
            information, I got it. You didn't
            care how.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I <u>did</u> care how.

<b>                        RACHEL

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            What're you gonna do, Rachel? You
            gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore?
            You want your job back? You want a

<b>                        RACHEL

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I'm sorry about that.

<b>                        RACHEL
</b>            What makes you think it's you?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            It's not me?

<b>                        RACHEL
</b>            You're a moron, you know that?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Yeah.

     DEAN smiles...and after a moment, so does RACHEL.

<b>                        RACHEL
</b>            When I need to reach Brill, I chalk
            the mailbox on 14th and Main.

     <b>EXT. CITY STREET - DAY</b>

     RACHEL is walking to the mailbox. She casually slashes
     the box with chalk and drops a letter inside.

<b>                        RACHEL (V.O.)
</b>            When he sees the mark, he knows
            there's a drop. The location's
            always the same.

     <b>EXT. BALTIMORE PORT - DAY</b>

     Establishing. Wharves, ships, seagulls. A water-bus
     chugs dockside as PASSENGERS board for the trip across
     the inlet. DEAN stands in a ticket line with the other
<b>     PASSENGERS.
</b>
<b>                        RACHEL (V.O.)
</b>            The number twelve ferry to Glen
            Burnie. Tuesdays or Fridays.

     <b>INT. FERRY - DAY</b>

     DEAN takes a seat. Across the deck is Seat 74. RACHEL
     takes the seat and casually slides an envelope behind
     it, her actions obscured by a bag she carries. The
     ferry BLOWS its departure horn.

<b>                        RACHEL (V.O.)
</b>            The drop's behind Seat 74. I leave
            something, he picks it up later.

     The ferry churns water. RACHEL moves to a wind
     protected seat, leaving Seat 74 empty. DEAN keeps watch
     on the seat as he scans the paper.

<b>                        DEAN (V.O.)
</b>            Any idea what he looks like?

<b>                        RACHEL (V.O.)
</b>            My guess is male, somewhere in his
            40's or 50's.

     A MONTAGE of different people occupying Seat 74.

     A middle-aged DRUNK passed out in the seat. A TEEN-AGED
     boy with glasses chats with friends.

<b>                        RACHEL (V.O.)
</b>            Race, height, weight, you're on
            your own.

     An OLD LADY reads a book. She sees DEAN eyeing her and
     smiles nervously. DEAN returns to his paper.

<b>                        RACHEL (V.O.)
</b>            Now I don't know how he's gonna
            feel about someone tracking him
            down. He's reclusive. I'm sure he
            has his reasons.

     DEAN's alone now. The ferry docks for the night. The
     last passengers, TWO NUNS, disembark. DEAN rises to go.
     Brill's a no-show.

     <b>INT. FERRY TERMINAL - NIGHT</b>

     DEAN walks down the ramp. It's dark in the empty
     terminal. Not the best place at this hour. Up ahead,
     TWO MEN stand in the darkness, then kissing. Down
     another hall, SOUNDS OF NEARING FOOTSTEPS. DEAN detours
     into--

     <b>INT. MEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS</b>

     Empty. DEAN stands at a sink, water running. He glances
     at the door. He splashes water on his face. Suddenly--

     --DEAN's slammed forward, a silenced pistol is shoved
     into his ear, pinning his face to the mirror.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Jesus! What?! You want money?!

<b>                        MAN
</b>            Shut the fuck up.

     Hands frisk DEAN. Up and down the legs, behind the back
     and chest. A wallet is removed, ID's looked at - then
     returned. DEAN turns to see--

     A MAN, early 50's. He sweeps a signal frequency locator
     over DEAN's body. The needle reacts at DEAN's foot.

<b>                        MAN
</b>               (gesturing)
            Your shoe.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            My shoe?

<b>                        MAN
</b>            Gimme the shoe.

     DEAN complies with the strange request as the MAN flips
     out a knife.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Brill?

<b>                        "BRILL"
</b>            Brill's dead. He died of small pox
            when he was two and he was buried
            in a Kansas field.
               (prying away DEAN's heel)
            My name doesn't matter.

     CLOSE ON DEAN's HEEL - a hollow compartment reveals a
     miniature tracking device. The MAN removes it, then
     returns the shoe.

<b>                        "BRILL" (CONT'D)
</b>            A tracker. Thousand yard range.
            They're close.

     The MAN reaches in a trash can, removes a potato-chip
     bag, wraps it around the tracker and flushes it down
     the toilet.

<b>                        "BRILL" (CONT'D)
</b>            C'mon.

     "BRILL" goes through the window. DEAN eyes the window,
     not sure. He eyes the door. Same feeling.

     <b>EXT. LOADING DECK - MOMENT LATER</b>

     DEAN crawls through the window to a loading dock.
     "BRILL" motions him to follow as he moves off into the
     shadows.

     The sounds of the window OPENING behind them, followed
     by FOOTSTEPS. "BRILL" shoves Dean behind a dumpster and
     removes his gun as two men run by. The STEPS FADE.
     "BRILL" looks. They're gone.

     <b>EXT. FERRY TERMINAL - NIGHT</b>

     Establishing. A closed farmer's market by the terminal.
     Several cars are parked. One's a cab. "BRILL" opens the
     driver's door. DEAN grabs the front passenger door.

<b>                        "BRILL"
</b>            No. In back like you're a customer.

     <b>INT. CAB - NIGHT</b>

     "BRILL" sits in the driver's seat, eyes flickering to
     all views, as DEAN climbs in the back. "BRILL" flips on
     the meter and guns into traffic.

<b>                        "BRILL"
</b>            What happened?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            It started with the information you
            gave me on DePinto. After we talked,
            he agreed to resign. Next, a phony
            detective asked me about Daniel
            Zavitz. Then an investigator
            questioned me about an extortion
            scheme they claimed Zavitz was
            behind. The FBI started looking
            into mob connections. A doctored
            picture in the paper. Overnight,
            I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank
            accounts, everything gone.

     "BRILL" eyes the mirror. A BLACK CHEVY appears several
     car lengths behind.

<b>                        "BRILL"
</b>            DePinto's dead.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Oh Jesus.

<b>                        "BRILL"
</b>            They found him yesterday folded
            neatly in a car trunk. What about
            Zavitz?

     "BRILL" starts to weave in and out of traffic. He looks
     in the mirror - the Chevy's also weaving several cars
     behind.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I don't know anything about Zavitz.

<b>                        "BRILL"
</b>            You said he was behind an extortion
            scheme.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            <u>They</u> said he was behind an
            extortion scheme.

     "BRILL" whips the cab around a corner, accelerating.

<b>                        "BRILL"
</b>            And you were the last one to talk
            to him.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Yes.

<b>                        "BRILL"
</b>            What'd he say to you?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Nothing.

<b>                        "BRILL"
</b>            What'd he give to you?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Nothing.

<b>                        "BRILL"
</b>            Don't bullshit me, I can save your
            life.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I'm telling you, I--

     The ride from hell gets worse as "BRILL" screeches
     another turn. The car ahead stops and "BRILL" screeches
     past on two wheels.

<b>                        DEAN (CONT'D)
</b>            I just gave him my card.

<b>                        "BRILL"
</b>            He didn't give you an address? He
            didn't give you a phone number?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Nothing. Two nights later I was
            robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.

     "BRILL" takes an impossible left into another alley.
     The Chevy follows. "BRILL"'s good. The guy in the
     Chevy's better.

<b>                        DEAN (CONT'D)
</b>            Um...who's that?

<b>                        "BRILL"
</b>            Don't know. Did you check everywhere?
            Maybe it was hidden in something.
            Maybe there was someone else--

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Someone else?

<b>                        "BRILL"
</b>            Maybe you bumped into someone who
            took it and you didn't even know.

     The cab is rear-ended hard by the Chevy. Their necks
     snap back from the force.

<b>                        "BRILL" (CONT'D)
</b>            Shit!

     WHAM! They're hit again. "BRILL" pulls out a communicator.

<b>                        "BRILL" (CONT'D)
</b>            209 to anyone! I need some help here!

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Who are you calling?!

     WHACK! "BRILL" back-hands DEAN with his fist, knocking
     him silly as WHAM!--the cab's rear-ended again.

<b>                        "BRILL"
</b>               (trying again)
            This is 209! Does anyone copy?!

     Then "BRILL" sees that the alley empties into a busy
     street, then a bakery shop.

     He slams the brakes. Tires screech smoke but it's no
     use. The powerful Chevy pushes the cab, bumper to
     bumper, toward the street. "BRILL" grips the wheel.
     It's all he can do as the cab rockets into cross
     traffic and--

     BLAM! They're broad-sided by a delivery truck. The cab
     is shoved sideways along the street and into a fire-
     hydrant, finally stopping under jetting water from the
     broken main.

     DEAN slowly opens his eyes. Water pours in everywhere.
     "BRILL" is sticking halfway through a window, not
     moving. Seeing "BRILL"'s pistol, DEAN grabs it and
     crawls from the wreckage.

     <b>EXT. STREET - NIGHT</b>

     DEAN climbs from the wreck as BYSTANDERS approach.

<b>                        WOMAN
</b>            Look out! He's got a gun!

     They back away as DEAN gets to his feet and looks
     around. Off to the side he sees the Chevy, waiting like
     a coiled snake.

     DEAN limps into the crowd. He rounds the corner to
     ANOTHER STREET and now he's running with all he's got left.

     <b>INT. DEAN'S HOUSE/STUDY - NIGHT</b>

     STACY is at the desk looking at the latest edition of
     the paper, which now has a photograph of DEAN and
     RACHEL walking in the park from the day before.

     The phone rings and STACY reaches for it...

            Stacy, don't hang up.

<b>                        STACY

<b>                        DEAN

            want you to take Eric and go to our
            parents house. I want you to do it
            right now.

<b>                        STACY
</b>            I went to the grocery store. My ATM
            and credit cards didn't work. I
            couldn't buy food.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I know.

<b>                        STACY
</b>            I went to the bank to see why. They
            said you emptied our accounts--

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            It wasn't me.

<b>                        STACY
</b>            This is science-fiction Robert! The
            manager showed me the transfer
            notice with your signature on it.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me.
            Now goddamit--

<b>                        STACY
</b>            My father's put me in touch with an
            attorney. He'll be--

     A hand suddenly clicks down the phone hook. DEAN turns
     to see a MAN, late 50's, gruff and alert. It's the guy
     driving the Chevy.

<b>                        MAN
</b>            Put the phone down. Do as I say.

     DEAN does nothing, temporarily frozen. A pistol jabs
     him hard.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Alright, alright--

     DEAN replaces the phone. The man removes DEAN's gun.
     Nearby, two PEOPLE chat at a restaurant hostess desk,
     unaware.

<b>                        MAN
</b>            Move to the elevators.

     DEAN does but is suddenly redirected through a roof-
     access door.

     <b>INT. VAN - NIGHT</b>

     A TECHNICIAN sits in a van jammed with high-tech
     surveillance gear. HICKS is next to him, a phone
     pressed to his ear.

<b>                        HICKS
</b>            We just picked up his call.

<b>     INTERCUT WITH:

     <b>INT. OFFICE - NIGHT</b>

     REYNOLDS, dressed in a tux, presses his cellular to his
     ear, while behind him MARSHAL and SHAFFER, also in
     tuxedos, have a heated discussion.

<b>                        REYNOLDS
</b>               (into phone)

<b>                        HICKS
</b>               (into phone)
            He had help.

<b>                        REYNOLDS

            Help from whom?
               (he hears the answer)
            Christ.

     <b>EXT. HIGH-RISE ROOFTOP - NIGHT</b>

     Eight stories up and deserted. The lit dome of the
     Capitol building shines like a beacon in the D.C. skyline.

     DEAN suddenly slams against a wall--

<b>                        DEAN

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            You knew the deal. No contact.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Who was that other guy?

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            One of many people who would live a
            word with you.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Who are they?

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            You've heard of the National Security

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            What do they have to do with this?

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            That's who they are.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            The NSA?

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Yes.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            You're crazy.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>               (starting to leave)
            Okay.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Wait.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            You drive a black BMW, license
            plate SRK1339?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Yeah.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>               (reaching in his pocket)
            I clipped this from your wheel well
            just before they towed your car away.

     BRILL pulls out a disk-shaped object the size of a
     walk-man.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            What <u>is</u> that?

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            It's a SAT-tracker.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I don't know what that means.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Like a LowJack, but two generations
            ahead of what the police use. It
            pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I don't know what that means.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band
            for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I don't know what that means.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            It means the NSA can read the time
            off your wristwatch.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Why are they after <u>me</u>?

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>.
            Which they probably are right now.
            'Bye.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Wait. What do I do?

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What
            you did, who you were...that's done.
            I'd find a quiet job somewhere
            shoveling snow.

     A helicopter hovers near the Washington Monument. BRILL
     eyes it cautiously.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Why don't they just identify
            themselves and tell me what they want?

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            They're spooks.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I don't know what that--

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Exposure. They can't have it. They
            wanna learn what you know and then
            deal with it.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I don't know <u>anything</u>.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            No shit.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            What am I gonna do?! I mean, like,
            for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Hey, if you live another week I'll
            be impressed.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            What if--

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Look, you gave me some work over
            the last year. We'll call it even.

     BRILL turns to leave--

<b>                        DEAN
</b>               (blocking the exit door)
            What if I find out what they're
            after. You know these people, I don't.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            And you won't. Now move--

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I'll pay you.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>               (taking out his pistol)
            They froze your accounts. Get outa
            my way.

     DEAN continues blocking the door, maintaining calm even
     as BRILL's pistol is pressed firmly to his forehead.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I've got a hundred-thousand dollars
            in jewelry in a safe-deposit box
            under a third party name.

     BRILL looks at the ground. Torn.

<b>                        DEAN (CONT'D)
</b>            How many years have <u>you</u> been hiding
            from them? How many years have you
            been running?
               (beat)
            What'd they do to you?

<b>                        BRILL
</b>               (pause)
            If you find something, chalk the
            Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go
            to Temperanceville. It's South of
            Salisbury.
               (giving DEAN his pistol)
            And take this.

     And with that, he's gone.

     DEAN eyes the gun. He walks to the ledge, looking at
     the city.

     DEAN'S POV: Several vehicles quietly pull up to the
     building. MEN storm out an move inside.

     DEAN quickly backs away.

     <b>INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT</b>

     DEAN races for the stairwell two steps at a time. He
     hears the SOUND of a DOOR OPENING somewhere below.

<b>                        VOICE (O.S.)
</b>            303 to 301. Floor one secured.
            Moving to two.

     DEAN retreats upward, then he hears SOMEONE COMING DOWN.
     Trapped. He opens the door on '3' and is about to run
     when he sees a security camera directly above.

     Grabbing a fire extinguisher, he pulls the pin. Spray
     coats the lens. Then he yanks a FIRE ALARM. A HORN BLARES.

     DEAN runs for the second stairwell when he sees JONES
     stepping out. DEAN looks back at the stairwell he left.
     That door's opening as well.

     Trapped.

     Using the extinguisher, DEAN smashes the glass door to
     an office and goes inside. JONES starts to enter when a
     shot rips into the wall, convincing him otherwise. He
     retreats as the BLARING FIRE ALARM STOPS.

     DEAN races through the suite of offices trying locked
     door after locked door. Finally, one opens and he
     rushes in and tries to lock it behind himself.

     No lock.

     He sees the MEN and they see him. He slides a desk
     against the door, then backs away, pistol ready.

<b>                        JONES (O.S.)
</b>               (disturbingly calm)
            Open the door, Mr. Dean. There's
            nowhere to go. We'd just like to talk.

     Seeing a phone, DEAN grabs it.

     No tone. Just a RECORDING of Nancy Sinatra's song
     "These Boots are Made for Walking".

<b>                        JONES (O.S.)
</b>            It'd be easier for all of us if you
            just come out. Nothing'll happen.

     DEAN heaves a coffee table up on the desk.

<b>                        JONES (O.S.)
</b>            It's quite hopeless what you're
            doing, Mr. Dean.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I swear to God I'll shoot.

<b>                        JONES (O.S.)
</b>               (chuckling)
            I think you might be over-reacting
            there, Mr. Dean. We just want to talk.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Go ahead. I hear you fine.

     The door pushes in--

<b>                        DEAN (CONT'D)
</b>            I said I'll shoot!

     The door keeps pushing.

     DEAN FIRES high.

     The pushing stops.

     Then DEAN hears the distant sound of SIRENS approaching.
     DEAN rips off his sweater, takes out a lighter, and
     sets the sweater on fire.

     He throws it into a garbage can and tosses styrofoam
     cups in on top of it.

     The pushing starts again, but before DEAN can fire, a
     small cylindrical device drops into the room.

<b>     A STUN GRENADE.
</b>
     DEAN ducks as a BLINDING FLASH rocks the room.

     The window is blown open. Smoke billows out. DEAN,
     temporarily blinded and deaf, struggles to a ledge as
     fire engines arrive.

     <b>INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS</b>

     Fire trucks, police cars and an ambulance arrive
     beneath DEAN as HICKS watches from his van.

<b>                        HICKS
</b>            I don't fuckin' <u>believe</u> this!
               (into radio-mic)
            301 to all units. Everyone out! Now!
            We'll take him at the hospital.

     <b>INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT</b>

     DEAN sits in back with a PARA-MEDIC, covered in soot,
     breathing hard through an oxygen mask as the ambulance
     WAILS and weaves through traffic. He looks through the
     rear window to see--

     TWO CARS FOLLOWING, keeping pace. Off to the side, RFK
     Stadium is emptying, a Redskins game is over.

     DEAN rips off the oxygen mask--

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Tell him to stop the ambulance.

<b>                        PARAMEDIC
</b>            Whoa there, fella. Just take it easy.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Tell him to stop the ambulance.

<b>                        PARAMEDIC
</b>            Now you're a little shaken up, but
            we're gonna get you on your feet in--

     DEAN whips out his pistol and shoves it in the
     PARAMEDIC's face--

<b>                        PARAMEDIC (CONT'D)
</b>               (to the driver)
            --stop the ambulance.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Thank you.

     <b>EXT. STREET - NIGHT</b>

     The ambulance pulls over and the back doors fly open.
     DEAN leaps out into the crowd.

     The OTHER CARS pull over and PRATT and JONES exit. They
     scan the area and see DEAN descending a stairwell
     marked: METRO.

     <b>INT. METRO STATION PLATFORM - NIGHT</b>

     DEAN stands at the end of the crowded platform. PRATT
     and JONES work through the CROWD as the train pulls in.
     DEAN slides on board. The departure HORN sounds. JONES
     and PRATT step on.

     <b>INT. METRO - NIGHT</b>

     DEAN huddles in the back car, panic-breathing, as PRATT
     and JONES move through the cars searching for faces.

     DEAN looks for an out. He sees an emergency stop handle.

     He YANKS it forward. PASSENGERS yell. The brakes lock
     and SCREECH. The train slows. Then stops.

     DEAN opens the door.

     And jumps. He looks around. Just black curved track in
     either direction. He starts running.

     Then he hears it.

     The horrible SCREECHING of an approaching train.

     Trapped.

     On one side, the train he left. On the other, a wall.

     He runs down the track with all that's left.

     PRATT and JONES reach the open door and see the
     oncoming train bearing down on DEAN. They duck in as
     the train SWISHES by.

     DEAN lays flat between the tracks, his face kissing
     greasy ground as the train screeches over him.

     Tons of angry steel are teasing his shirt fabric.

     Then it's over. The train's gone. DEAN's alive.

     He gets up to see PRATT and JONES leap to the tracks.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>               (under his breath)
            I hate these guys.

     Then he sees an "EMERGENCY ACCESS" sign beaming in the
     darkness. A God-send. DEAN runs for it.

     <b>EXT. METRO EMERGENCY ACCESS EXIT - NIGHT</b>

     PRATT and JONES fly out the door and into a park.

     It's empty. Quiet.

     No Dean anywhere.

<b>                        REYNOLDS (V.O.)
</b>            I'm confused about something. Maybe
            you can help me out.

     <b>EXT. TERRACE - CONTINUOUS</b>

     The Lincoln Memorial is seen in the distance. REYNOLDS
     has broken off PARTY GUESTS and paces in his tux, an
     encrypted cellular phone pressed to his ear.

<b>                        REYNOLDS (CONT'D)

</b>            Puffed cheese?

<b>                        REYNOLDS
</b>            No thank you.

     The WAITER goes back inside.

            Now is that clear?

<b>                        WAITER
</b>            Yes sir.

     REYNOLDS disconnects, breathes deeply, and goes back to
     the party.

     <b>EXT. RACHEL'S CONDO BUILDING - NIGHT</b>

     DEAN watches from the shadows. It seems quiet. He's
     about to move for the entrance when he sees--

     A cigarette lighter flame-up inside a parked car. TWO
     MEN sit inside, watching. DEAN retreats into the shadows.

     <b>EXT. RACHEL'S CONDO - BACK ENTRANCE - NIGHT</b>

     Quiet. DEAN listens through the door and hears nothing.
     He KNOCKS softly.

     No reply.

     He tries the doorknob. It opens.

     <b>INT. RACHEL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT</b>

     DEAN enters. The place is still.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Rachel?

     No answer. DEAN drifts through the living room. A lamp
     is knocked over on the floor. DEAN keeps moving into
     the bedroom. He stops in the doorway - eyes fixed inside.

     DEAN'S POV: RACHEL lies on her stomach, naked in bed.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>               (approaching)
            Rachel?

     She doesn't respond. He touches her.

     Nothing.

     He turns her over. Her face is frozen, eyes open, neck
     purpled and bruised with signs of strangulation.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Oh God--

     DEAN wants to throw up but holds it down.

     Then, under a night table, he sees a shirt. He grabs it.

     DEAN'S POV: An oxford button-down. The inside collar is
     stamped with a dry-cleaner's marker reading: R. DEAN.

     Panic overtakes horror as DEAN quickly searches for
     anything else of his that may have been planted inside
     the apartment.

     Under the bed - a cufflink.

     In the bathroom - a hairbrush.

     On the desk - documents with his name on them.

     DEAN shoves everything into a garbage bag. Grabbing a
     towel, he retraces his steps, wiping his prints from
     everything he touched.

     Exiting, he wipes off the doorknob as--

     A NEIGHBORS DOOR OPENS. A COUPLE stumbles out, laughing,
     kissing...and noticing DEAN leaving Rachel's condo.

     <b>INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT</b>

     JERRY walks alone through the large underground garage
     on the way to his car. He pauses, thinking he's heard
     something.

     Nothing.

     He continues walking. He reaches his car. Suddenly
     someone comes up behind him fast. JERRY spins--

     --it's DEAN.

<b>                        DEAN

</b>            It's the NSA. They're the ones
            doing this.

<b>                        JERRY
</b>            Bobby--

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            The NSA's doing this 'cause they
            think I have something. And they
            killed--

<b>                        JERRY
</b>            Calm down.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            They killed Rachel.

<b>                        JERRY
</b>               (pause)
            Rachel's dead?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Yes.

<b>                        JERRY
</b>            Jesus.

<b>                        DEAN

<b>                        DEAN

<b>                        JERRY
</b>            Why would the NSA--

</b>            No, listen to me. You gotta let me
            bring you in.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            No, I--

<b>                        JERRY
</b>            You gotta let me bring you in to
            the police.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They
            won't let me get there. You go.

<b>                        JERRY
</b>            To the cops?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em
            to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what
            they're after. Make a deal.

<b>                        JERRY

</b>            I have a family.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            So do I!

     JERRY looks at the ground for a long moment...

<b>                        JERRY
</b>            I'm sorry, man.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            No. No, it's okay.

     DEAN starts to leave...

<b>                        JERRY
</b>            Bobby? Piece of advice?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Yeah?

<b>                        JERRY
</b>            Turn yourself in.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Jerry?

<b>                        JERRY
</b>            Yeah?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Go fuck yourself.

     <b>EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING</b>

     Establishing. A quiet street in Dean's neighborhood.
     Several REPORTERS are camped in Dean's driveway
     entrance, sipping coffees. Farther down the street, a
     JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE is parked. The driver waits and
     watches.

     <b>EXT. BACKYARD - SAME TIME</b>

     DEAN sneaks between two large houses, ducking by
     windows and scaling a fence. Somewhere a DOG BARKS a
     warning as DEAN plows through a large hedge, entering
     the backyard to his home.

     <b>INT. DEAN'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - SAME TIME</b>

     DEAN quietly unlocks the door and enters. He listens.

     The house is quiet. Empty.

<b>     INT. DEAN'S FOYER - DAY
</b>
     KEYS JINGLE in the front lock. The door opens and STACY
     enters.

     The TV suddenly REMOTES ON - VOLUME LOUD.

     She turns as DEAN approaches fast--

<b>                        STACY
</b>            Robert--

     DEAN's hand cups her mouth as he pulls her into a
     pantry closet.

     <b>INT. PANTRY CLOSET - CONTINUOUS</b>

<b>                        DEAN
</b>               (barely a whisper)
            Listen to me. The house is bugged.
            So we gotta be quiet, okay?

     STACY nods understanding. DEAN slowly removes his hand.

<b>                        DEAN (CONT'D)
</b>               (whispering)
            Is Eric in school?

<b>                        STACY
</b>            Yes.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?

<b>                        STACY
</b>            Just reporters.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I wish you'd gone to your parents
            like I asked you.

<b>                        STACY
</b>            This is my house. Nobody's kicking
            me out of my house. I picked those
            drapes.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I don't think anybody wants the
            drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes
            are okay.

<b>                        STACY
</b>            What happened to your head?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I was in a car chase and a small
            explosion. Now listen to me: The
            NSA is behind this. They think that
            guy I told you about, Daniel Zavitz,
            they think Zavitz gave me a tape or
            computer chip of some kind that
            could be damaging to them. So
            they're doing all these things
            <u>electronically</u>. The bank records,
            the surveillance. They're the ones
            who broke into the house. Now I
            know there's no reason to believe
            me. But I love you. And I love our
            son. So just believe me anyway.
               (pause)
            Please.

     STACY gently touches his forehead where he's been cut...

<b>                        STACY
</b>            Does that hurt?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Well...yeah.

<b>                        STACY
</b>            Good.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Stacy--

     She grabs him and kisses him. The kiss lasts a good
     long time before STACY smacks him on the arm--

<b>                        STACY
</b>            I <u>told</u> you they could do this. I
            <u>told</u> you they had this kind of
            capability and that with this anti-
            terrorism it would be just another--

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the
            best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.

     She kisses him again.

<b>                        STACY
</b>            I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            That's okay.

<b>                        STACY
</b>            I opened the present you got me
            from Harrison's.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            You opened the thing?

<b>                        STACY
</b>            The lingerie.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            That was for Christmas.

<b>                        STACY
</b>            I was missing you.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            You're as bad as Eric. I've got an
            entire family of people who root
            through--

     It dawns on him...everything starts coming together...

<b>                        DEAN (CONT'D)

<b>                        STACY

     <b>INT. JEEP GRAND-CHEROKEE - DAY</b>

     The DRIVER continues to watch the area. Then--

     DRIVER's POV: THE RANGE ROVER flies out of the driveway,
     tires SCREECHING as it speeds through the quiet
     neighborhood.

     The REPORTERS stare at each other a beat--

     --then leap for their cars.

<b>                        DRIVER

<b>                        DRIVER

<b>                        JONES (O.S.)
</b>            Alright - move! 501 - all units.
            Take him down!

     <b>EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS</b>

     Unmarked cars of various descriptions rapidly appear
     from nowhere giving chase.

<b>                        ANOTHER AGENT (O.S.)
</b>               (radio effect)
            502 to 501, I've got the eyeball.
            He's approaching Ridgeview, we'll
            take him at the intersection.

     The RANGE ROVER speeds through the neighborhood.
     Suddenly, two cars are out in front, blocking the way.
     The Range Rover swerves and breaks as two more cars rip
     up behind, boxing it in. An un-marked Trans-Am lags
     behind, keeping reporters at bay.

     Doors fling open. JONES and THREE MEN, all in plain
     clothes, pistols and MAC-10 aimed at the Range Rover.

     Nothing happens.

     The MEN move closer--

     JONES grabs the door and rips it open, revealing Dean's
     PISS-FRIGHTENED NANNY behind the wheel in Dean's trench
     coat and hat.

     JONES YANKS her out, puts her hard to the ground, gun
     jammed to her head, as other search the Range Rover for
     Dean.

     <b>EXT. DEAN'S DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS</b>

     DEAN drives the Nanny's rusted, low-rider Dodge out of
     the driveway. He pauses and looks. The streets are empty.

     He turns onto the street and calmly drives away.

     <b>EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY</b>

     Establishing. A playground jammed with kids. A kickball
     game's in progress. ERIC waits his turn to kick. TRACY,
     a college-age teaching assistant comes over.

<b>                        TRACY

     ERIC looks up...

<b>                        TRACY (CONT'D)

            I've got a question for you, and
            it's incredibly important that you
            tell me the truth. Under no
            circumstances will I be angry with

            <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the
            Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there.
            Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes.
            We took the GameBoy out of the bag,
            but with every intention of putting
            it back.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>               (pause)
            You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.

     DYLAN hunts through the backpack as DEAN and ERIC looks
     on. All kinds of junk flies out--candy, comics, game-
     cartridges--

<b>                        DYLAN
</b>            It was broken when we found it, I
            swear. I tried fixing it for you. I
            even put in new batteries.
               (pulling out the GameBoy)
            The screen scrambles whenever you
            boot up. I'd try to get your money
            back.

     DEAN eyes the pieces of the GameBoy, knowing that
     somewhere in the puzzle of plastic and chips is the key
     to his problems.

     <b>EXT. BALTIMORE SHERATON - EVENING</b>

     PEDESTRIANS walk on the sidewalk. A MAN comes along and
     drops a few letters in the corner mailbox.

     From the other direction comes DEAN. Without stopping,
     he casually slashes the mailbox with chalk.

     <b>INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT</b>

     DEAN's asleep. There's a SOFT SHUFFLING SOUND. The
     CAMERA EXPLORES for the source, moving by the windows,
     flashing neon, a TV and finally, the door.

     We PUSH CLOSER as a MULE TOOL snakes under the door.

     The tool pops upright against the door's inside. The
     strap drapes over the doorknob and tightens. The
     doorknob turns and opens.

     SOMEONE slips in--

     CLOSE ON DEAN asleep. A HAND covers his mouth. DEAN's
     eyes go wide.

     Then he sees it's BRILL...

<b>                        BRILL
</b>               (whispering)
            Get dressed. We're leaving.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>               (whispering)
            You could knock on the door, you
            know, and I'd open it.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Move it.

     <b>EXT. CAPE CHARLES - 4 A.M.</b>

     Establishing. The 10-mile Chesapeake Bay Bridge crosses
     the Bay like a serpent worming toward distant Norfolk.
     Traffic is thin at this hour.

<b>                        NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
</b>            Dean, the attorney recently under
            investigation for a money laundering
            scheme, was seen leaving Ms. Banks
            apartment late last night.

     We PUSH IN on a TOYOTA PICK-UP truck heading south.

     BRILL drives with DEAN riding shotgun.

     BRILL ejects as cassette from the dashboard and hands
     it to DEAN.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            And you were worried about me.
            That's nice, I appreciate--

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            I was worried about my hundred and
            twenty 'K'.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            We said a hundred.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            The price rises with the temperature
            and right now you're smokin'. But
            you're right, you should shop
            around and get the best price. I'll
            just let you out here.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>               (agreeing)
            One-twenty.

     BRILL checks the rear-view mirror.

     BRILL's POV: Car headlights following in the distance.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Did you call anyone?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            What do you mean?

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            I mean did you call anyone.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Look, my wife is understandably--

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Jesus!

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I called my wife!

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            What'd I tell you?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I didn't use my name.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            What'd I tell you?

<b>                        DEAN

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            I told you no calls.

     BRILL does a bootleggers U-turn. Several cars pass by
     in the opposite direction.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Sorry.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            You don't get it. They go through

            monitor everyone you called in the
            last--

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I didn't use my name.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Oh, I'll bet <u>that</u> threw 'em off the
            scent. I sure hope you covered the
            mouthpiece with a handkerchief and
            used a funny voice!

     BRILL turns off the headlights, does another U-turn,
     pulls off on an emergency road and stops.

     He turns off the engine, rolls down the window, looks
     up into the night sky and listens.

     BRILL's POV: A cloudy night. Silent except for the
     water and a distant fog-horn. No sounds of aircraft.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>               (looking up as well)
            I don't hear anything.
               (on BRILL's silence)
            Maybe you're wrong.

     BRILL is staring upward...

     glowing monitors.

     CLOSE ON A MONITOR - displaying a live SAT feed showing
     a thermograph image of Brill's truck. The color heat
     image of BRILL looking upward is fairly clear. He pops
     his head back into the truck and pulls onto the road.
     The satellite continues tracking the truck.

<b>                        BRILL (O.S.)
</b>            It's a consumated marriage.

     <b>INT. TOYOTA - NIGHT</b>

     BRILL drives along a high fence surrounding acres of
     empty warehouses, docks and rust-bitten fences. He's
     still on constant alert - looking for sign of their
     presence.

<b>                        BRILL (CONT'D)
</b>            The NSA's been in bed with the
            entire tele-communications industry
            since the 40's. They've infected
            everything: Banks, computers,
            phones, mail, name it.
               (stopping the car near
                the gate)
            The more technology we buy into,
            the easier it is keeping tabs on us.
            It's a brave new world.
               (handing DEAN the keys)
            At least it better be.

<b>                        DEAN

<b>                        BRILL

     DEAN gives him a look that says, "I don't know what
     that means".

<b>                        BRILL (CONT'D)
</b>            I intercepted phone calls.

<b>                        DEAN

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            They can tap anything as along as

            SATs. We'd suck in everything. All
            foreign, most domestic.
               (DEAN re-closes the gate)
            Domestic was my group. Druggies,
            radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we

</b>            Welcome to Santa's Workshop.

     <b>INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT</b>

     BRILL and DEAN enter the 2nd story of a large, empty
     structure. DEAN is carrying a crumpled, brown paper bag.

     In the center of the cavernous space, a windowless,
     cinderblock room built on 5-foot supports.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            I call it the jar. No phone or
            utility lines going in.

     BRILL opens a side door revealing a mini-generator. He
     pushes the start button. The generator HUMS to life.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Self-contained. Unplugged from the
            world.
               (opening Jar door)
            Nothing for a wire bug to piggy-
            back in on. That leaves only
            transmitters and signal sweep for
            those.
               (turning on the light)
            Now let's see what we got.

     DEAN tosses the paper bag to BRILL, who empties its
     contents (the pieces of the GameBoy) on to the table.

     <b>EXT. DOCKS - DAWN</b>

     DEAN sits alone, smoking a cigarette, and watching
     Norfolk rise from dawn's fog.

     In the distance we see BRILL coming down from the
     warehouse toward DEAN.

     He stands behind DEAN for a moment before...

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            That is one ugly sunrise.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>               (pause)
            It really is.

            Did you find anything?

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Yeah.
               (beat)
            Take a walk with me.

     DEAN gets up and joins BRILL. The two of them start in
     the direction of the second warehouse.

<b>                        BRILL (CONT'D)
</b>            Remember when Senator Hamersley
            died in an accident up near Shenandoah?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Yeah.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            The NSA killed him.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Jesus. Do you have proof?

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof.
            Could you walk a little faster please.

<b>                        DEAN

<b>                        BRILL

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Who?

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Them.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Where?

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Here?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            <u>Here</u>?!

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            In the warehouse. They're hiding in
            a duct on the third floor. When we
            go back inside, they're gonna kill
            us. When they notice that we're
            moving toward the car, they'll come
            running out of the building.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            'Kay, well, could you walk faster,
            please.

     <b>INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS</b>

     JONES and THREE MEN are huddled in a duct.

            They're heading to the car.

<b>                        JONES
</b>            Move it.

     JONES and the three men start down the corridor, guns
     drawn.

     <b>EXT. THE SECOND WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS</b>

     DEAN and BRILL are kneeling beside the Chevy, letting
     the air out of the tires.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat.
            And turn your head. There might be
            some debris flying your way.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Why?

     And with that, THE FIRST WAREHOUSE EXPLODES, sending a
     fireball of debris in all directions.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            What the fuck?!

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            They shouldn't have come without
            calling first.

     BRILL jumps into the Chevy, turns the key and the
     engine ignites. DEAN leaps in. BRILL stomps on the gas
     and tires screech. The Chevy hurtles through the
     warehouse toward a shut garage door. BRILL clicks a
     remote. The door rises.

     OUTSIDE THE WAREHOUSE - The Chevy roars outward,
     screams around a corner, then speeds down a road lined
     with warehouses.

     DEAN looks down an intersecting road to glimpse a
     Saturn sedan gaining on a parallel road.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Where's your gun?

     They pass an area with no warehouses. The Saturn turns,
     heading straight at them.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Back at the warehouse.

     The Saturn pulls on the road behind them. The MAN in
     the Saturn leans out and fires an assault rifle. The
     side window by Dean's head shatters.

     BRILL one-hands the pistol and checks the load.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>               (re: the pistol)
            Gimme that.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            You sure?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            You're driving.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Those are Feds.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>               (taking the pistol)
            I didn't see a warrant. Did you see
            a warrant?

     The Chevy enters a narrow lane, the Saturn right behind.
     With the Chevy's tires flat and flapping, the Saturn
     hugs their rear. DEAN looks back again as the RIFLEMAN
<b>     FIRES--
</b>
     The rear window EXPLODES. DEAN pops up and fires three
     quick, well-placed rounds.

     The Saturn swerves and drops back. BRILL's impressed.

     DEAN looks forward to see an exit road blocked by an
     iron cross-bar. BRILL, unfazed, pushes the Chevy faster.
     Beam or no beam, he's going through.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Think we let out enough air?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>               (realizing)
            Oh my God...

     BRILL and DEAN hit the deck as the Chevy's hood scrapes
     just under the beam. The windshield frame takes the
     full impact. The beam slices through steel and glass,
     decapitating the car. They emerge on the other side
     minus roof and windows as--

     --the Saturn SCREECH-STOPS inches from the beam and
     debris. A MAN leaps out, shoulders his rifle and aims--

     --but the Chevy disappears around a building.

     <b>EXT. HIGHWAY - EARLY MORNING</b>

     A foggy morning. The rural highway's deserted at this
     early hour. The Chevy rumbles by...

     <b>INT. CHEVY - CONTINUOUS</b>

     DEAN and BRILL, windblown but alive, remove shards of
     glass. BRILL eyes the road behind him.

     Empty.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            We lost 'em.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            That wasn't so hard.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Fuckin-A.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Let's not do the tire thing anymore,
            okay?

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Yeah, I can see where that'd--

     He stops talking.

     He hears ROTOR THUMPS as a black HELICOPTER appears
     over a fog-laced hillside, swooping down.

     BRILL floors it. The helicopter drops in closer as
     BRILL swerves back and forth while taking a curve at 70-
     plus on flapping tires. A helicopter SHARP-SHOOTER aims
     with an M-16.

     A spray of high-powered slugs suddenly rip into the
     Chevy's hood. The engine starts knocking.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            These guys are incredibly persistent.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Tell me about it.

     The road straightens. Up ahead, a tunnel.

     More bullets slice the hood. Radiator fluid starts
     hissing. The Chevy starts dying.

     BRILL stomps the pedal, squeezing out every last kick
     of horsepower.

     Rubber flaps. Tires shred. Steam hisses. Bullets fly.

     The helicopter swoops in lower and lower for the kill shot.

     <b>INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS</b>

     The SHARP-SHOOTER lines DEAN in his sights.

     The PILOT keeps pace, dropping closer. The SHARP-
     SHOOTER has the shot.

     The Chevy reaches the tunnel's opening on sparking,
     screeching wheel rims.

     The helicopter pulls up, missing the hill by inches.

     But not the power lines. The PILOT sees them too late.
     The helicopter flies into a web of cables. The upper
     rotor slices neatly off. The helicopter's body rockets
     downward to the road where it bounces and skids like a
     rock on water until it meets an oncoming semi-truck
     head-on.

<b>     BLAM!
</b>
     <b>EXT. INSIDE THE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS</b>

     BRILL tries steering but metal wheels on concrete don't
     work. The car shimmies like it's on ice. Sparks fly as
     they bash into the tunnel wall, grinding to a stop.

     <b>INT. DODGE - CONTINUOUS</b>

     A GRUNGE-DUDE blasts his car-stereo as he enters the
     tunnel, unaware of the mayhem behind him.

     He slows, seeing a smoking wreck ahead.

     Closer, he sees DEAN waving him down. He slows more.
     Bad move.

     BRILL opens the rear door, leaps in, and points his
     pistol at the GRUNGE-DUDE's face.

     DEAN leaps in front.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Drive.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            We're not gonna hurt you.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Drive or I'll blow your fuckin'
            head off.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            No he won't.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Goddammit--

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            We're honest people and we need
            your help. I'll give you two-
            hundred dollars if you--

<b>                        GRUNGE-DUDE
</b>               (leaping out)
            Take it!

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Actually, I don't have two-hundred
            dollars.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Drive the damn car!

     DEAN slides into the driver's seat, drops it in gear
     and goes.

     The Dodge erupts from the tunnel.

     Up ahead, the Saturn and another car approach fast in
     the opposite lane, speeding toward the tunnel's opening.
     The car's fly by, unaware of DEAN and BRILL passing in
     the Dodge.

     The Dodge continues on, fading into the fog.

     <b>INT. NSA/CORRIDOR - DAY</b>

     REYNOLDS and HICKS walk down a white hallway three
     football fields in length, filled with bustling
     employees conservatively dressed.

<b>                        HICKS
</b>            We found two sets of latent prints
            in the rubble of Brill's studio.
            One was Dean's. The other, we

<b>                        REYNOLDS

<b>                        HICKS

<b>                        REYNOLDS

<b>                        HICKS
</b>            If he's with Lyle it means he's got
            resources.

<b>                        REYNOLDS
</b>            Resources, that's a good point.
            He's got resources. All we've got

     REYNOLDS walks off leaving HICKS to ponder his fate.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            It'd never get through. All

            then hand-searched for explosives.

<b>                        DEAN (V.O.)
</b>            Senator Sam Albert, senior
            Republican. Very well respected.

     <b>INT. BOSTON UNIVERSITY/AUDITORIUM - DAY</b>

     A large auditorium. Preparations are being made for

     casually case the area for vulnerabilities.

     Next to CHRISTA, looking conservative and <u>altered</u> in
     appearance, is DEAN, eavesdropping on the Senator's
     room numbers and any other pertinent info.

     A clock reads 1:28 AM. The lights are on and the bed
     unslept in. Christa's not seen. Then the connecting
     door opens--

     CHRISTA steps from the Senator's adjoining suite in a
     silk robe, nothing underneath. She turns in the doorway,
     revealing ALBERT, naked in a towel.

     CHRISTA closes the door, climbs in bed and grabs the
     remote. She clicks on the TV.

     FEEDBACK SCREECHES from the set.

     She tries changing channels but the SCREECHING
     continues. She tries turning off the set, but it won't

     sips coffee, skims news, and eavesdrops on their
     MURMURS with a small, concealed parabolic mic and ear-
     phone.

     <b>EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY</b>

     CLOSE ON A FREQUENCY COUNTER sweeping a chest of

     BRILL, disguised, is on hands and knees, searching
     under a chest where he 'discovers' a bug he planted
     earlier.

</b>            Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as

<b>                        BRILL

     BRILL unwraps a towel revealing the grease-covered NSA
     tracker he removed from Dean's BMW.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            I yanked this off your RV. It's a

     PATRICK escorts BRILL out of the RV.

     The SENATOR, fuming, opens a book, looks up a phone
     number and punches it into his phone.

<b>                        SENATOR ALBERT

     <b>INT. UNIVERSITY COFFEE SHOP - DAY</b>

     A place packed with STUDENTS, computers and TEACHERS.
     DEAN sits in a corner reading a magazine, but what he's
     really watching is--

     A WELL-DRESSED MAN at the counter, his back to DEAN,
     ordering a cup of coffee.

     The MAN glances at DEAN off the mirror behind the counter.

     BRILL walks in and joins DEAN.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Albert's primed. We'll let him stew
            for a day and then drop the tape.

     BRILL looks over at the WELL-DRESSED MAN.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            He came in four minutes ago.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>               (pause)
            C'mon.

     They're about to start for the front door when an
     unmarked police car pulls up in front.

     A rowdy group of FRAT BOYS flood in, loud and busy. By
     the time they pass, BRILL and DEAN are gone.

     The WELL-DRESSED MAN scans the coffee shop and sees the
     back door swinging shut.

     <b>EXT. STREET - DAY</b>

     DEAN and BRILL run down the street, through an alley
     and over a fence to another street. They slow as they
     approach the parked Taurus. BRILL takes the wheel with
     DEAN beside him.

     They pull into traffic. Things look good, but then the
     UNMARKED CAR and a SQUAD CAR scream up behind, lights
     flashing.

     <b>INT. TAURUS - CONTINUOUS</b>

     BRILL dumps the car into low gear and the Taurus comes
     alive.

     <b>INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS</b>

     A COP picks up the radio-mic.

<b>                        COP
</b>            One-Lincoln-Nine. In pursuit of two
            suspects, one matching description
            of Robert Dean, wanted in connection
            with a homicide. Suspects northbound
            on--

     <b>EXT. BOSTON STREETS - CONTINUOUS</b>

     Through alleys, down streets, under an overpass, down a
     one-way street, barely missing a head-on as they roar
     into a rail-yard traversing the waterfront. BRILL's at
     his best, putting distance between himself and the cops
     at every turn.

     Finally, it looks as if they've made it as they race
     down an alleyway, only to realize it's a dead-end.

     BRILL slams into reverse. They screech backward, tires
     smoking.

     Too late. The squad car rips into the alleyway, boxing
     them in.

     BRILL hits the brakes. He looks back at the dead-end
     and sees an empty flat-bed trailer with a ramp. BRILL
     gives it everything. If they can get enough speed and
     hit the ramp right, maybe they can clear the obstructing
     wall.

<b>                        BRILL
</b>            Feeling lucky?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Not particularly, no.

     They hit the ramp full speed. The front end bottoms at
     the Taurus bounces skyward. Tires clip the wall as the
     car flips and smashes into a parked rail-car filled
     with coal.

     They aren't going anywhere.

     Back in the alley, the squad car skids to a stop.

     A ROOKIE climbs from his car, leaps the wall, draws his
     gun and nears...

     Inside the Taurus, the windows are shattered. Steam
     hisses, gasoline drips and coal is everywhere.

     DEAN shimmies out through a broken side window. He
     barely gets to his feet as he stumbles 20 yards or so.

     His foot accidentally dislodges a large pile of coal,
     which buries him up to his waist and immobilizes him.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Shit.
               (to BRILL)
            I'm stuck. Help me out.

     He looks back to see that BRILL is hanging out the
     driver's side, bleeding badly and covered in gas.

<b>                        COP
</b>               (on waist radio)
            One-Lincoln-Nine, suspects TA'd
            into a coal car at the Fullbright
            rail-yards. Requesting back-up,
            fire and ambulance.

     An unmarked car with red-flashers races up the rail-
     yard and stops. The ROOKIE turns as JONES and KRUG hop out.

<b>                        JONES
</b>               (flashing ID)
            FBI. What do you got?

<b>                        COP
</b>            Two murder suspects. One's wounded,
            the other's maybe dead.

<b>                        JONES
</b>            Thank you.

     KRUG draws his silenced pistol and matter of factly
     shoots the COP dead.

<b>                        JONES
</b>               (to KRUG)
            Check inside.

     DEAN is watching this all unseen, helplessly trying to
     dig himself out of the coal.

     KRUG inspects the Taurus interior for anything of
     interest. JONES scans the area.

<b>                        KRUG
</b>               (to BRILL as he searches.)
            I hate doin' cops, I really do. You
            I won't mind. Didn't mind that
            Rachel Banks. Didn't mind doin' her
            one bit.
               (seeing DEAN's shoe)
            Your lawyer friend buried over there?

     BRILL can only gurgle blood. JONES pops the Taurus's
     trunk had looks inside.

     KRUG digs quickly through the coal pile, searching for
     Dean. Then BRILL sees him--

     BRILL's POV: DEAN down off the side of the coal-car,
     lodged in the coal pile. He's safe, but not once KRUG
     discovers he's not in the car.

     BRILL pushes in the cigarette lighter.

     JONES dumps everything from the Taurus into the
     unmarked car. SIRENS suddenly fade in.

     KRUG digs faster, looking for DEAN, as JONES approaches
     with his pistol, clambering around for BRILL.

<b>                        KRUG
</b>            Fuck him, he's dead in two minutes.
            Find Dean.

     JONES starts to back out, just as the Taurus's
     cigarette lighter pops out. BRILL grabs it.

     KRUG eyes the glowing lighter. Then he eyes BRILL.

     Shit.

     BRILL ignites the gas. WA-WOOMFF!! A fireball explodes,
     consuming all - the car, BRILL, KRUG. JONES is blown
     off his feet from the concussion.

<b>                        JONES
</b>               (scrambling away)
            Fuck--

     JONES wipes prints off his pistol and silencer and
     tosses it into the flames as the police cars approach.

     DEAN watches from the shadows as flames incinerate
     everything.

     Establishing. Peaceful street, quaint apartments. THREE
     MEN stroll to the entrance of a well-maintained
     building. One jimmies the lock and a moment later
     they're in.

     <b>INT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS</b>

     HICKS, JONES and DAVIS prepare. All have miniature
     earphones. DAVIS checks his silenced pistol. HICKS
     activates a frequency locator. The needle snaps on. He
     looks at DAVIS and JONES.

     They're ready.

     All hand signals, no words, as the trio ascend the
     staircase.

     One flight, two. Then HICKS stops. The needle says
     they're close.

     HICKS motions. Their target's on two. They move down
     the hall - silent except for a creaking floor and a TV
     SHOW drifting from an apartment.  Someone's up at this
     hour.

     They move on. HICKS watches the needle as it moves. He
     motions DAVIS and JONES to a door. JONES puts a
     reverse-viewer against the peep-hole.

     JONES's POV: A view of an entryway and living room. A
     light bleeds from an O.S. source. Beyond that there's
     no sign of life.

     HICKS puts a contact-mic against the door and listens
     to FAINT CONVERSATION somewhere inside, possibly the
     phone call. HICKS nods to JONES who quickly picks the
     lock while DAVIS eyes the hall.

     After a nervous moment, the door opens and HICKS, JONES
     and DAVIS enter.

     They spread out, searching the well-decorated condo for
     the target.

     They near the room with light. Using a mini-mirror,
     HICKS looks around the bend to see--

     A BEDROOM. There's a briefcase on the bed.

     They enter.

     From the bathroom they hear sounds of RUNNING WATER.
     They slowly approach. Wood again CREAKS beneath them.

     DEAN's VOICE is heard through the locked door.

     HICKS signals "on three".

     He counts, and they SMASH the door open to see--

     --a cellular phone taped to a Baby-Monitor. DEAN's
     nowhere in sight.

     While JONES continues on the door, DAVIS runs to the
     window.

     Throughout this, HICKS will stand in the middle of the
     room and, simply, oddly, stare at the mantle over the
     fireplace.

     sure no one else is lurking. In the bedroom, they find
     the briefcase. Inside the briefcase--

     --listening bugs, installation equipment and
     compromising photos of the Senator with Christa.

     The DOORBELL rings. REYNOLDS is alarmed.

     Now there's BANGING at the door and DOORBELL RINGS again.

<b>                        REYNOLDS WIFE (O.S.)
</b>               (from the bedroom)
            Who is that, dear?

     REYNOLDS snaps the phone shut and goes downstairs to
     the door.

     When he opens the door he sees TWO FBI AGENTS with
     their ID's flapped open and six uniformed POLICEMEN
     backing them up.

<b>                        FBI AGENT
</b>            John Reynolds?

<b>                        REYNOLDS
</b>            What the hell--

<b>                        FBI AGENT
</b>            You're under arrest. You have the
            right to remain silent. Anything
            you say--

<b>                        REYNOLDS WIFE (O.S.)

            Honey...?

     <b>INT. DEAN'S STREET - MORNING</b>

     A PAPERBOY tosses a newspaper at the Dean's door.

<b>                        SENATOR ALBERT (O.S.)
</b>            Privacy and the right to privacy is
            an <u>inalienable</u> right.

     <b>INT. DEAN'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS</b>

     Stacy has C-SPAN on the TV while she makes breakfast
     for ERIC. SENATOR ALBERT is addressing the SENATE.

<b>                        ERIC
</b>            These guys are always making speeches.

<b>                        STACY
</b>            It's an important speech, Eric.
            There's gonna be a vote today.

<b>                        SENATOR ALBERT
</b>               (on TV)
            Today we face a threat to that
            creed. Certain individuals in our
            intelligence community believe
            they're entitled to examine lives
            in minute detail, and claim to do
            it in the name of the common good.

<b>                        ERIC
</b>            If they're voting today, hasn't
            everyone pretty much made up their
            minds.

<b>                        STACY
</b>            Actually, this man appears to have
            changed his mind dramatically.

<b>                        ERIC
</b>            Why?

<b>                        VOICE (O.S.)
</b>            He saw the light, my son.

     ERIC and STACY whip around--

<b>                        ERIC
</b>            Dad!

     STACY and ERIC run to DEAN...

<b>                        STACY
</b>            Is it over?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            It's over.

<b>                        ERIC
</b>            How long can you stay?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I
            live here.

     ERIC and DEAN hug.

<b>                        STACY
</b>            Get ready for school, you're gonna
            be late.

<b>                        ERIC
</b>            Is it okay to use the phone now?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            It's okay to use the phone.

<b>                        ERIC
</b>            Alright!

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            No "900" numbers.

     But ERIC has disappeared up the stairs...

<b>                        STACY
</b>            It's really over?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Albert's gonna get me my job back.

<b>                        STACY
</b>               (pause)
            I'm sorry about Rachel.

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            Yeah.
               (beat)
            I wish you could've met...

<b>                        STACY
</b>            Who?

<b>                        DEAN
</b>            A friend of mine. I don't know his
            real name. He's dead now.

<b>                        STACY
</b>            You did good.

     STACY points to the TV and DEAN watches for a moment...

<b>                        ALBERT
</b>               (on TV)
            I've lived through the dark ages of
            Hoover's Watch-List and McCarthy's
            Witch Hunts - men who used moral
            crusades, fired by fear, to lay
            waste to our freedoms.

<b>                        STACY
</b>            C'mon upstairs. I've got a
            Christmas present from Harrison's I
            want to show you.

     DEAN arrives as STACY takes him by the arm. They head
     upstairs as ALBERT continues on...

<b>                        ALBERT
</b>               (on TV)
            Our intelligence communities
            presently monitor our phones,
            computers, financial transactions,
            medical histories...all this and
            more. Some of you may say, "Fine.
            I'm not a criminal and I have
            nothing to hide." Well God forbid
            we ever edge to tyranny. God forbid
            George Orwell's version of America
            becomes a reality. We are <u>that</u> close.

     ALBERT's speech continues as we...

<b>     ROLL END CREDITS.
